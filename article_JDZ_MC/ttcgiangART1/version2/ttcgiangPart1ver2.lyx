\begin_layout Abstract
Global persistence of infectious diseases is a big problem for epidemiologists.
 Studies have showed that there are a lot of reasons to answer why many
 communicable diseases still exist and have been developed in more dangerous
 form.
 The asynchrony and the recolonization among subpopulations are two key
 reasons pointed out.
 However, why these are the asynchrony and the recolonozations in a metapopulati
on is still an open question.
 Here we study the combined effects of forcing phase heterogeneity in the
 seasonally forced contact rate on global persistence of disease.
 We carry out an exploitation of stochastic dynamics in a susceptible-exposed-in
fectious-recovered (SEIR) model of the spread of infectious diseases in
 a metapopulation of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations.
 Starting with continuous-time Markov description of the model of deterministic
 equation, the direct method of Gillespie(1977) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1977exact"

\end_inset

 in the class of Monte-Carlo simulation methods allows us to simulate exactly
 the spread of disease with the SEIR model.
 Our finding of the exploitation of stochastic dynamics points out that
 the persistence of the disease in the metapopulation is characterized as
 an exponential survival model on data simulated by the stochastic model.
 Using a parametric survival model for an exponential distribution (R package
 'survival' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "survival-package"

\end_inset

), we estimate the global extinction rate which represents the global persistenc
e of disease in the meta-population.
 Besides, we estimate the locale extinction rate and the recolonization
 rate in metapopulation by using the Poisson process.
 We find how bigger the forcing phase heterogeneity becomes, and how smaller
 the local extinction rate gets.

INTRODUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
News about infectious diseases has always been a subject of worry to parents
 as well as all.
 It has brought many problems to humain society.
 Recent works have shown that infectious diseases do spread in space 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cumming2004,Grenfell2001,Smith2004,viboud2006synchrony"

\end_inset

.
 The exact form of disease movement depends on a number of local factors
 (demographic including population size 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004"

\end_inset

, growth rate and death rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2007"

\end_inset

, sociological such as school period of children, work tendency from rural
 to urban, environmental and climatic comprising seasonal variations in
 seasonality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010,Griffen2009"

\end_inset

, temperature and rainfall, immunological for diseases, etc...) as well as
 the connections between the different populations (i.e.
 spatial structure) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yan2007"

\end_inset

 such as distance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004"

\end_inset

, coupling rate, number of individuals between populations, etc....Hence, we
 focus on spread of disease in space by using variations in the seasonal
 aspects of subpopulations and after examine how synchrony could affect
 the persistence of infectious diseases in a metapopulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In modeling of ecological system, presenting interactions between humans,
 subpopulations, geographic conditions and the metapopulation model is a
 good choice.
 Metapopulation is a set of subpopulations with mutual interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

 here a subpopulation can only go extinct locally and be recolonized by
 another after it is emptied by extinction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hanski1998,Levins1969"

\end_inset

.
 A metapopulation is also a population of populations (subpopulations).
 Such a structure implies an heterogeneity in the sense where the probability
 of contact (or contact rate) between individuals from a same subpopulation
 is higher than the probability of contact between individuals of different
 subpopulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hanski2004"

\end_inset

.
 Such heterogeneity is actually the result of the interaction between two
 phenomena that are often difficult to disentangle in nature.
 The first one relates to the granularity of the metapopulation (as rendered
 by the number of and sizes of subpopulations) and the second one relates
 to the isolation between subpopulations (as can be rendered, among others,
 by physical distances separating each pair of subpopulations).
 Moreover, according to the findings of Benjamin Bolker (1995) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1995"

\end_inset

, there is no coexistence between periodicity and disease persistence in
 non-spatial measles models, and spatial structure is an important factor
 to both enhance persistence and create new types of dynamic behaviour.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the disease persistence capability in a metapopulation depends
 positively on level of synchrony/asynchrony between subpopulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004,Heino1997"

\end_inset

.
 Many studies showed that the synchronization of epidemics in all asynchronous
 subpopulations causes the recolonization of diseases for locally extinct
 subpopulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hagenaars2004,Hanski1998,Heino1997,Yaari2012"

\end_inset

.
 So, the recolonization becomes the main reason for which disease persistence
 exists.
 The disease always appears in metapopulation if and only if there is at
 least one non-extinct subpopulation.

in order to explain why measles persists after lot of vaccination policies,
 Bolker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996"

\end_inset

 used the measles data before and after vaccination from 1964 to 1988 in
 England and Wales.
 Vaccination has broken high synchrony between the UK cities in prevaccination
 era, and at the same time, causes decorrelation and enhances global persistence
 of the infection, because of decorrelating factors of vaccination such
 as the starting moment of vaccination policies, number of susceptibles
 vaccinated and interaction between vaccination policies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Rohani1999"

\end_inset

.
 A decrease in correlation between subpopulations may make a metapopulation
 more difficult to eradicate infectious diseases
\series bold
 
\series default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Earn1998"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the level of synchrony between the subpopulations is strongly
 governed by the migration rate and distances between them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heino1997"

\end_inset

.
 In our modern world, the distance problem isn't large anymore for individuals
 who want to travel.
 There are a lot of cities very remote, but very connected, and thus very
 synchronous as in the USA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Choisy2012"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, migration among subpopulations has become a big problem.
 The disease synchrony speed within a metapopulation can strongly increase
 when migration rate there is strong 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KeelingRohani2008"

\end_inset

.

\series bold
 
\series default
The migration rates are directly proportional to the amount of variation
 in metapopulation size, but inversely to the amount of variation in subpopulati
on size, over time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dey2006,Griffen2009"

\end_inset

.
 So, migration is key to the recolonization of empty subpopulation and simultane
ously increases the degree of synchrony between subpopulations in spatially
 structured metapopulation.
 However, the vast majority of infectious diseases control policies that
 are applied in the world are still based on rationales that do not consider
 the local extinction/recolonization dynamics.
 This is maybe a reason why measles persists

around the world, despite highly local vaccine coverages

.
 For example, in the start of the 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO)
 had officially stated the global measles epidemic outbreak.
 In the first three months of the year 2014, there were about 56,000 cases
 of measle infections in 75 countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WHO2014a"

\end_inset

, including countries in south-east Asia and most particularly, Vietnam
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "http://healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/measles-reemerges-vietnam-22814"

\end_inset

.
 We discovered measles persistence in the world for many years without extinctio
n, from one nation to another as well as from cities to other cities.
 Though the moment of disease outbreaks in each region differs.
 For neighbouring regions with disease persistence, there is a time-lag
 differs between disease outbreak.
 This is explained in sociology by difference in culture, in geographic
 condition and more particularly seasonality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonality has been one in rather robust ingredients influencing the disease
 persistence process.
 Seasonal changes can alter migration tendency between urban and rural areas
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ferrari2010"

\end_inset

, also residence time of hosts, vectors and pathogens.
 Seasonal variation can thus determine population size, migration and interactio
n capabilities and particularly infection rate at which susceptible individuals
 become infected 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Altizer2006,Hosseini2004"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, infectious disease outbreak occurs due to this infection rate.
 However, finding a clear mechanism of seasonal forcing for modelling is
 a very difficult work because of unidentified formula for seasonal forcing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Altizer2006,Ferrari2010"

\end_inset

.
 For indirectly transmission diseases such as water-born and vector-born,
 finding seasonality characteristics is less a problem, however, in direct
 contrast to transmission diseases such as measles.
 Seasonal forcing in a metapopulation is influenced by weather and climate
 in region, school schedule of children, and rural-urban migration in countries
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1995,Conlan2007,Ferrari2010,Gunning2013"

.
 In these factors, the seasonal aggregation of children in primary schools
 affects clearly the infection rate in metapopulation.
 The infection rate decreases due to children holidays but is inverse when
 the children come back to school

exploring the influence of seasonality for the infection rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in simulation has been developed in many previous years.
 If the infection rates given are the same in all subpopulations, so this
 metapopualtion model is a rather simple model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rozhnova2012,Rozhnova12013"

\end_inset

 and the symmetry of the fixed points among subpopulations will not be broken.
 In contrast, if the infection rate is different in all subpopulations,
 so we have a more complex oscilation metapopulation model, but close to
 the oscilations in reality.
 Thus, realizing the oscilations of infectious diseases in life within metapopul
ation simulation models to estimate global disease persistence time has
 become a large problem and the infectious disease eradication has become
 our aim

Here we propose a simulation study to quantify the effect of synchrony on
 the persistence of infectious diseases.
 We use stochastic simulations for infectious diseases in a metapopualtion,
 then we consider different spatial structures from the simplest to more
 complex.
 These forcings can reflect local demographic, sociological, environmental,
 or climatic factors.
 The level of synchrony is computed from the phases of forcing in the different
 subpopulations and persistence is quantified by using statistical tools
 from survival analysis.
 Here, we are concerned about measles and simultaneously use the parameter
 values from articles and measles reports.
 As the persistence of measles has been largely studied in the literature
 and its still unexplained while global persistence is a growing concern
 for WHO and public health authorities around the world

To do this, we first build the deterministic model for a metapopualtion.
 Then, we describe the spatial structure for the SEIR metapopulation model.
 Finally, we introduce the characterization of mass extinction, locale extinctio
n and recolonization in the metapopulation based on the measles characteristics.

 The formulation of the metapopulation model with environmental and movement-bas

 :

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\label{eq:dS}\\

\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}\label{eq:dR}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 et 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the numbers of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered in this
 sub-population 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Individuals are born susceptible, die at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

, become infected with the force of infection 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$

, infectious after a latency period of an average duration of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sigma$

 and recover at the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 The force of infection depends not only on the total population size

\end_inset

 and the number of infected 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 in subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i,k}$

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{j}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i,j}$

 visits subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{M}\rho_{ij}=1$
\end_inset

 See appendix for detail on the construction of this equation.
 We can verify that in the limit case on one single subpopulation in the
 metapopulation (
\begin_inset Formula $i=j$

\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

) we have

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Describing the strength of connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in a metapopulation (subpopulations connected by individual movement) is
 quite complex.
 In this work, we will study the null model (model 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

), which is a metapopulation without any explicit spatial distance (all
 the subpopulations are at the same distance from each other) and where
 all the metapopulation have the same population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 Like the original Levins's model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

, this model considers that all the subpopulations are at equal distance
 from each other: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}=\rho,\qquad0\leqslant\rho\leqslant1,\qquad\forall i,\forall j.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Hence, we will focus on studing three key parameters that characterize
 the metapopulation: (i) the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of sub-populations, (ii) the population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall i$
\end_inset

) of all these subpopulations and, (iii) the coupling (or distance) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

 between two subpopulations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that refers to the the probability that an individual from subpopulation

 As a result, for the subpopulation

 is the time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{i0}$
\end_inset

 With the annual sinusoidal form of the average contact rate, we really

\begin_layout Standard
In our metapopulation model, we define a new parameter

 A given synchrony value

 in radian that is in the interval from zero to

 Hence, the value of the forcing phase of the

 value in the set.

Measuring persistence (local and global)

\begin_layout Standard
The Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA) uses Monte Carlo (MC) methods
 to study the evolution process of disease in continuous time by solving
 the corresponding stochastic differential equations.
 In our work, we focus on studying demographic and environmental stochasticities
 in epidemic models.
 Demographic stochasticity is considered as fluctuation in population processes
 that are based the random nature of events at the level of the individual.
 Each event is related to one baseline probability fixed, individuals are
 presented in differing fates due to chance.
 Besides, the number of infectious, susceptible, exposed and recovered individua
ls is now required to be an integer.
 Modeling approaches that incorporate demographic stochasticity are called
 event-driven methods.
 These methods require explicit consideration of events.
 The first approach published by Daniel T.Gillespie in 1976 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 is an exact stochastic simulation approach for chemical kinetics.
 The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) has become the standard
 procedure of the discrete-event modelling by taking proper value of the
 available randomness in such a system.
 The methods modelling the event-driven model demands explicit presentation
 of events.
 For the standard SEIR model, we have to consider the nine events that can
 occur, each causing the numbers in the relative groups to go up or down
 by one.

\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 for subpopulations in a metapopulation, we fixe the metapopulation size
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 We compute the equilibrium values of these variables by using the equilibrium
 equations of the system (in appendix).
 We simulate the fluctuation of a single population with the size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and the simulation time of 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 years, to obtain stationary regime for disease dynamic.
 At the 
\begin_inset Formula $100^{th}$
\end_inset

 point, we get the stationary values of variables.
 Now, with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations in the metapopulation, the initial values of variables for
 each subpopulation are identical and equal to the stationary values divided
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Thereby, we build successfully the stationary metapopulation just at the
 initial step of simulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous analyses have demonstrated that there are recurrent waves of extinction
 and re-colonization in spatial dynamics within subpopulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Estimating the ability of the disease persistence is still a complex problem
 and there is no exact formule to calculate this ability.
 Such, estimating global persistence as well as local, recolonization, and
 the link among local persistence, local extinction, recolonization is the
 focus of this paper.
 We will reveal methods how we can measure the rate of the local/global
 extinction and of the recolonization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, in order to measure global extinction rate, we simulate a metapopulation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations.
 We gain 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 independent fluctuations of our stochastic model.
 Then, we calculate the average metapopulation size by summing subpopulations
 at each sample time and averaging across the entire time series for each
 metapopulation.
 Lastly, we record the dates 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of global disease extinction in all these 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 metapopulations.
 These dates allow to draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves from which we estimate
 the global extinction rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M(t)=\exp(-\chi t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant M(t)\leqslant m$
\end_inset

) is the number of metapopulations in which the disease is not extinct at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that, we use the parametric survival model for the exponential distributio
n (R package '
\begin_inset Formula $survival$
\end_inset

' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "survival-package"

\end_inset

).
 Due to that, we can capture one of the most important features of stochastic
 systems in spatial structure : its global extinction characteristics of
 disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides, to compute local extinction rate that illustrates the probability
 of local extinction event in the duration of fluctuations in incidence.
 We save up all disease duration in all subpopulations of the metapopulation.
 We consider the data array like a Poisson process and we estimate local
 extinction rate from this data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also save up durations where there is no disease in all subpopulatio
ns of the metapopulation.
 We have a data set like a Poisson process and we assess recolonization
 rate for the metapopulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Plan of experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will describe our plan of experience to quantifying
 the effect of synchrony on the persistence of infectious diseases in a
 metapopulation.
 We have three big concerns that we must verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(1) relations between rates: local extinction rate, global extinction rate
 and recolonization rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2) effects of the population parameters (such as the number of subpopulations
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and the coupling rate
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) and of the environmental parameters ( such as the amplitude of the average
 contact rate
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}$
\end_inset

and the synchrony parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the number of subpopulations 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 : this parameter plays an important role in metapopulation.
 For a given metapopulation size, this number is inversely scaled the subpopulat
ion size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The coupling rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

: it illustrates the strength of connextion among subpopulations in a metapopula
tion.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0$
\end_inset

, the subpopulations are totally independent.
 But with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1$
\end_inset

, the subpopulations are an unified population.
 The metapopulation becomes a big population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The amplitude of the average contact rate
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}$
\end_inset

: this parameter introduces the influence of the season on the disease persisten
ce of the metapopulation.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}=0$
\end_inset

, the metapopulation is in static state, any environnemental factor affects
 dynamics of metapopulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The synchrony parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 is an important parameter that we use to break fixed points as well as
 first fixed points at begining moments between subpopulations.
 The effect of increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 drives the synchronization between subpopulations down.

, there is a good agreement between simulations and analytic results for
 the synchronization and phase lag between subpopulations in the metapopulation.
 We implemented the simulation for the SEIR metapopulation model of subpopulatio
ns coupled by individual movement with time-varying periodic contact rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result shows that the number of subpopulations in the metapopulation
 strongly affects the extinction rates, increasing the number of subpopulations
 leads an increase of the rates of local extinction as well as global extinction.
 The extinction rates of the synchrony is always higher than that of the
 asynchrony in the independent metapopulation as well as in the coupled
 metapopulation.
 Moreover, the extinction rates of the metapopulation of independent subpopulati
ons is larger than the one of the metapopulation of coupled subpopulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to investigate the dependence among subpopulations, we use a parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that is referred to the coupling interaction.
 Increasing the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 means that we increase the strength of connection among subpopulations
 in a metapopulation.
 Besides, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

 is an important parameter which clearly reflects the difference between
 subpopulations'phases.
 With the decreasing of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

, we increase the similarity between sub-populations, but we limit the chances
 of re-colonizations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model of isolated subpopulations no immigration, the subpopulations
 fluctuate totally independently.
 The rescue ability of disease among subpopulations is zero.
 It is why the probability of disease persistence is smaller than the case
 of the metapopulation of coupled subpopulations.
 Decreasing the probability of disease persistence leads an increase of
 the rates of global extinction as well as of local extinction.
 These extinction rates of the metapopulation without connection is greater
 than the metapopulation with connection.
 Due to no immigration among subpopulations, the rate of recolonization
 is zero in all cases, it means that the disease can not turn back when
 a subpopulation did find the local extinction.
 However, a model of isolated subpopulations no immigration is impossible
 in our world, so this result is only significant for theory, but non-significan
t for reality.

Moreover, by fitting the seasonality amplitude of the average contact rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}$
\end_inset

 at which a susceptible will have when visiting city 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 per unit of time, so as to describe more exactly the variation in contact
 rate due to the opening and closing of schools, to term-time forcing and
 more further, to an age-structure.
 A forcing model will appear, when we make 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1}$
\end_inset

 be greater than zero, the average number of contacts per unit of time of
 each subpopulation will be a sinusoidal function.
 Besides, to describe the seasonal phase difference among subpopulations,
 we use the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

 to adjust the phase difference of disease between seasonal air-temperature
 variations in a metapopulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the synchrony in the metapopulation, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The subpopulations are grouped into pairs based on their interactions,
 and particularly their disease phases are in-phase.
 All the subpopulations are in synchrony.
 So the ability of rescue effect among subpopulations are small, they simply
 get extinct.
 Consequently, the local extinction rate when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=0$
\end_inset

, is higher than when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

 is different from zero.
 On the other hand, the asynchrony is presented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The phase variation in disease dynamics of the coupled subpopulations are
 out of phase, the synchrony is interrupted.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=\pi$
\end_inset

, the decreased similarity between sub-populations leads an increase of
 the chance of recolonization among sub-populations.
 A sub-population has even reached the local extinction, but the disease
 comes easily back due to the recolonization among sub-populations.
 Hence, the rates of local extinction as well as of global extinction in
 the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\neq0$
\end_inset

 is lower.
 Briefly, the extinction rates of the synchrony is better than that of the
 asynchrony.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, in the coupled model, when the number of subpopulations increase,
 we can see that the the local extinction rate of the synchrony goes closer
 to that of the asyschrony.
 Because, first we increase the number of subpopulation, we increase the
 similarity among subpopulations, we decrease the ability of the recolonization
 among subpopulation, and one more plus point, increasing the number of
 subpopulation in the case of the fixed metapopulation size makes the subpopulat
ion size decrease.

In this experience, we are interested in the influence of the number of
 subpopulations on the local extinction rate for the standard SEIR model
 without forcing.
 This simple metapopulation model just investigates subpopulations connected
 by individual movement without environmental transmission.
 In the non-seasonal model, the average number of contacts per unit of time
 of a susceptible when visiting another subpopulation is set as a constant.
 The strength of connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for the model of isolated subpopulations (island model) and different from
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for the model of coupled subpopulations (coupling model).
 Hence, in this case, the main factor affecting the extinction rate is the
 migration of individuals rather any environmental factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result shown in the Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInfNbPOPIslandModel_a"

\end_inset

 points out that in the isolation model with the fixed metapopulation size,
 the increased number of subpopulations leads to a decrease of the subpopulation
 size.
 This limits the ability of the rescue effect to ensure locally extinct
 subpopulations become recolonized.
 Hence the local extinction rate rises significantly, and is greater than
 that of the coupled model without forcing.
 Besides that, due to the disjunction among subpopulations in the metapopulation
, a subpopulation will obtain the global extinction immediately after it
 get the first local extinction, so any there won't be any recolonization
 occurs in this island model.
 The recolonization rate is zero in all cases as shown in the Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInfNbPOPIslandModel_b"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inverse to the coupled model, the strength of interaction between the two
 subpopulations have clearly demonstrated its influence on the extinction
 ability in metapopulation.
 The curve of the coupled case will be increased notably when the number
 of subpopulation extends in the range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $26$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in above obtained results of the Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInflNbPOPLocExt"

\end_inset

, although the number of subpopulation augments but is still small, the
 number of native individuals in a subpopulation is much larger than the
 number of tourists in any specific time.
 Thus, for the fixed metapopulation size, the increased number of subpopulations
 draws a decline of the subpopulation size.
 The disease of subpopulation easily get extinct, whenever the local extinction
 rate augments.
 However, when the number of subpopulation becomes a large number, then
 the subpopulation size becomes really small.
 The ability of disease persistence significantly decreases, then the rates
 of extinction augments.
 As pointed out in the Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInfNbPOPIslandModel_b"

\end_inset

, the recolonization rate has the same form to the local extinction rate.

One more factor that was pointed in the introduction part is coupling strength
 between subpopulations.
 Here, the coupling rate or the dispersal rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 can be considered as migration strength.
 The disease transmission speed grows fast when coupling rate goes up in
 metapopulations.
 Similar to that, global disease persistence surges also.
 In this part, we permit coupling rate change from weak to strong in a metapopul
ation of five subpopulations with the population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1e6$
\end_inset

 for each subpopulation.
 The dispersal rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is divided into three intervals.
 These are low, intermediate and high coupling rate intervals.
 In each interval, we chose some coupling rates that highlight the coupling
 strength among subpopulations in a metapopulation.
 With each value of coupling rate, we estimated local extinction rate that
 presents the extinction probability of disease in a subpopulation.
 We have result as following figure Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "figCoupleMETA"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the coupling rate is small from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

, the locale extinction rate significantly decreases.
 However, this rate is minimum when the coupling rate has medium values
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

.
 Lastly, the extinction rate augments back when the coupling rate is very
 strong from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

.
 As shown in the Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figCoupleMETA"

\end_inset

, the local extinction rate in a metapopulation is one humped function for
 the coupling rate.
 The medium coupling rate (from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

) minimises the extinction rate of disease in metapopulation.
 Because in the case of the small and medium coupling rates, the coupling
 rate and the speed of migration among subpopulations are directly proportional.
 The dispersal speed increases.
 Thereby the local recolonization speed rises, the duration of persistence
 grows, the local extinction rate goes down.
 However, this trend of local extinction with decreasing coupling rate,
 is not right any more when the dispersal rate is strong.
 The metapopulation has tendency to become one big population.
 In this case, the phase difference or the recolonization among subpopulations
 are no longer significant.
 Hence, the local extinction rate rises.

We successfully have built a version for the susceptible-infected-recovered
 stochastic metapopulation model (subpopulations connected by individual
 movement), which describes both movement-based and environmental transmission.
 The infection rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 has portrayed all effects inside as well as outside of the disease tranmission
 chain between individuals in the same subpopulation or in other subpopulations.
 Moreover, our metapopulation model became more detailed when we brought
 seasonality in metapopulation model to create periodic transmission in
 year that highlighted seasonal changes as well as school period of children

.
 We have metapopulation model with different contact rates for each subpopulatio
n.
 This is a more complex model than any used metapopulation model.
 We have sketched successfully in-phase and sometime out-of-phase (

This complex metapopulation model is also an expected result of Rozhnova(2012)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It's a good result for scientists wanting to use the SEIR metapopulation
 model for simulating dynamics of infectious diseases.
 Our results roughly support those of Rozhnova's 2012.
 The authors gave different values of the contact rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 of each subpopulation.
 However, the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 here are fixed by constants and the number of subpopulations in experiences
 are maximum of three.
 We don't know why these authors made simulations with just three cities.
 We find that, this number of subpopulations is quite small and the obtained
 result is not enough strong to ocnfirm.
 Comparing this result with our's, in a coupling metapopulation, the degree
 of synchorny is maintained when the coupling rate between subpopulations
 is weak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, our stochastic SEIR metapopulation model with subpopulations connected
 to each other, we have quantified disease extinction of seasonality as
 well as spatial synchrony.
 With our model, we can easily create level of seasonality in year and at
 the same time, phase difference in seasonality between subpopulations.
 It's the reason why we have model quite close to the metapopulation model
 in reality.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, for approaches of measuring the probability of disease persistence
 in a metapopulation, as previous analyses, the ability of disease persistence
 was characterized by fitting an exponential survival model

 on a data simulated by a stochastic model.

To measure the persistence in ecology and epidemiology, so many methods
 we can use 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010,Gunning2013,Keeling2002"

\end_inset

.
 For example, Keeling et al.(2002) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keeling2002"

\end_inset

 gave two methods.
 One method was for an isolated metapopulation without migration by calculating
 the expected extinction time or the extinction rate during a given period.
 This was a theoretical measure as no real data exists to compare with model
 results.
 The other method for a population with migration was found by calculating
 the number or the total duration of extinctions.
 Then in 2010, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 methods proposed by Conlan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010"

\end_inset

 were used to quantify persistence by basing on the proportion or on the
 frequency of zero reports in a given reporting interval.
 The above approaches have the same point that they are easily calculated
 in all models from simple to complex.
 But, the obtained results are not exact, because as we mentionned above,
 the curves of disease persistence are Kaplan-Meier survival curves that
 present the lifetime of every subpopulation, so the ability of disease
 persistence is estimated as a survival function and in fact, it was proved
 as an exponential survival model.
 Hence, in this paper, we have revealed a new method.
 We have mesured the rates via Kaplan-Meier survival curves and survival
 functions.
 Our obtained results held the true values of the rates with the confidence
 interval of 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the phase difference between infection coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, we can change by an increase or a decrease in level of synchrony.
 We want to decrease level of synchrony, by simply increasing the phase
 difference between forcing phase coefficients in the formulas of contact
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the level of synchrony between two subpopulations are the worst
 when the two fluctuations are in antiphase (as figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInflNbPOPLocExt"

\end_inset

).
 When the phase difference between oscillations increases, the desynchronizing
 effect on population dynamics of the subpopulations augments.
 This declines the ability of disease extinction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, as the result above (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figInfNbPOPIslandModel"

\end_inset

) and the global extinction rate (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

), our results, along with those of Bolker (1995)

 and Heino (1997) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, stress the asynchrony that is the main factor that reduces the probability
 of global extinction.
 Disease is always available in metapopulation if and only if at least one
 subpopulaiton is not extinct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our finding has specified the two main factors influencing the persistence
 ability of an infectious disease.
 One factor is transmission characteristics of the infectious disease and
 the other is interplay between mixing subpopulations in metapopulation.
 The interaction between the disease persistence and the spatial heterogeneity
 becomes a major key to unlock questions about infectious disease in epidemiolog
y.
 This result takes a large part in epidemic disease persistence domain that
 has being exploited in scientific epidemically research works.
 We gained a robust understanding of how disease extinction is affected
 by local factors such as spatial heterogeneity, demographic asynchrony
 and seasonality, as well as mixing factors such as migration, disease transmiss
ion between hosts and pathogens.
 Lastly, we also highlighted recolonization effects.
 It is like rescue for disease.
 Because of connection between subpopulation, individuals can go everywhere.
 Subpopulation is quickly re-infected althought the disease has became extinct.
 Thus, the disease rescus makes local extintions difficult to extend into
 global extinctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a matter of the fact of coupling strength among subpopulations in metapopulat
ion, we proved that
\series bold
 
\series default
the extinction of the disease in the metapopulation is not only computed
 by a exponential survival function over time, but also a concave function
 for the coupling rate.
 In addition, the disease extinction in metapopulation is minimum when the
 coupling rate between subpopulations is just medium.
 This finding is similar to those of Huffaker(1958)

sinusoidally forced SEIR stochastic metapopulation model.
 This model is like a physical system of coupled oscillators.
 We have pointed out that spatial synchronization consistently and predictably
 makes extinction risk increase by using the model 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 where all the subpopulations have the same population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and there is no explicit spatial distance.
 So, it's good for the future, we can continue this work with different
 population size of each subpopulation and different spatial distance between
 subpopulations and then, create synchronous metapopulations that optimize
 vaccination policies.

\begin_layout Standard
We start with ordinary differential equations for a 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 in a metapopulation as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\\
\frac{dE_{i}}{dt} & = & \lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu E_{i}-\sigma E_{i}\\
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} & = & \sigma E_{i}-\mu I_{i}-\gamma I_{i}\\
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 In simulation, we know that the equilibrium state allow a disease to persist
 in a population for a long time.
 So, an infectious disease in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 is available in long term this system is at equilibrium.
 It means that at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dS_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dI{}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dR{}_{i}}{dt}=0$
\end_inset

 (*).
 Thus, we let all equations (equations 
\begin_inset Formula $15$
\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Formula $18$
\end_inset

 ) in the system be equal to zero, then calculate the values of the variables
 (now denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 , and 
\begin_inset Formula $R{}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

) that satisfy this condition (*).
 We have these values as folllows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}{\beta\sigma}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma+\mu}-\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta\sigma}\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\frac{\beta\sigma-(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}{\beta(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, if we set 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}=\frac{\beta\sigma}{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}$
\end_inset

, so we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One nomal conditions for all population availabes is that the equilibrium
 values cannot be negative.
 Therefore, an infectious disease is available in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}>1$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the endemic equilibrium in the system is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{i}^{*},E_{i}^{*},I{}_{i}^{*},R{}_{i}^{*})$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $(N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)$

\begin_layout Subsection
Stationary distribution in metapopulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we show some assumptions for the stationary distribution model as follows
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 1.
 For each city 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

, there exists a markov chain 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 describing where (i.e.
 in which city) individuals native from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 travel at each time step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 2.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 has a stationary distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 3.
 At time t=0, each agent is located in a city randomly drawn from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we consider a simplified model in which the dynamics of the agents
 is stationary: each agent native from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 no more follows a markov chain, but is relocated at each time step on a
 city randomly drawn from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, under assumptions 1,2,3, at any time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, when the total number of agents grows to infinity, the size of the populations
 under the markovian dynamics converges towards the size of the populations
 under stationary dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, any statistics computed on the densities of agents from the same
 population in various cities will not distinguish the markovian from the
 stationary dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this conclusion, we will deploy a stationary distribution in a
 metapopulation.
 First of all, we choose a population size N for the metapopulation.
 Then, we compute the After that, the transition matrix converge towards
 a stationary distribution matrix.
 Finally, we apply the stationary distribution matrix in the metapopulation
 of n subpopulations

\begin_layout Proposition

\begin_layout Subsection
The background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One general question is always posed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how does the population of exposed individuals of subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 evolve ?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For the sake of simplicity, in the process of transmission of the SEIR
 model, we focus on the incidence and we assume for now that the latent
 period and the recovery rate, repectively 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\sigma=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we write a probabilistic formulation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming the time is discrete, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}\approx\mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\setminus E_{i,t}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\setminus E_{i,t}\right] & = & \mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\cap S_{i,t}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{x\in C_{i}}Pr\left[x\in E_{t+1}\wedge x\in S_{t}\right]\\

 An individual

 Let

 The correct mathematical approach for this would be to assume that for

\end_inset

, the number of people native from 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 that we meet during 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$

 follows a Poisson process.
 So both the number of people we meet and the number of infected people

 should be random variables.

\begin_layout Standard
In the approach described in

We have the probability so that a susceptible individual

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in S_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[\bigwedge_{\begin{array}{c}

\begin_layout Standard
Then, we plug this back into the previous formula, and we get:

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & = & 1-\prod_{k=1}^{M}\left(1-c_{ik}\right)^{\kappa_{j}\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\delta t}

\begin_layout Standard
The first order approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\prod_{k=1}^{M}(1-c_{ik})^{v_{k}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{M}-v_{k}\log(1-c_{ik})$
\end_inset

.
 Applying this approximation here, we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & \simeq & \delta t\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(-\kappa_{j}\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\log\left(1-c_{ik}\right)\right)

Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{ijk}=-\kappa_{j}\log\left(1-c_{ik}\right)$

Call 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant\delta_{ij}<2\pi$
\end_inset

) the phase difference between subpopulations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 : 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{ij}=|\varphi_{i}-\varphi_{j}|\bmod2\pi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi{}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi{}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are the phases of the contact rates (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) in subpopulations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 et 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Populations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 are perfectly in phase if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 and in opposition of phase if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}=\pi$
\end_inset

.
 We can thus define the degree of synchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}=\xi_{ji}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant\xi_{ij}\leqslant1$
\end_inset

) between populations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{ij}=1-\frac{\left|\delta_{ij}\right|}{\pi}.

\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}$

\begin_layout Standard
Consider that in the metapopulation the phases 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the contact rates in the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations are evenly distributed between 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\leqslant\pi$
\end_inset

).
 We can express the mean of the pairwise phase differences 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<\!\!\delta_{ij}\!\!>\;=\;<\!\!\delta_{ji}\!\!>\;=2\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{(n-k)k}{(n-1)n^{2}}=\frac{n+1}{3n}\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and thus the mean of the synchronies 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}=\xi_{ji}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<\!\!\xi_{ij}\!\!>\;=\;<\!\!\xi_{ji}\!\!>\;=1-\frac{n+1}{3n}\frac{\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}}{\pi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty}<\!\!\xi_{ij}\!\!>\;=1-\frac{\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}}{3\pi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
This last result shows that, for a high enough number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of subpopulations, the mean value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}$
\end_inset

 does not depend on the number of subpopulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are chosen so that they are uniformly distributed between 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny min}}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

.
 The distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the number of subpopulation, but only depends 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
\end_inset

 and may be is characterized by one single parameter (we choose the average
 value of all 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}$

), view figure
