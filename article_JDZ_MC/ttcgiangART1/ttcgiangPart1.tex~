\section{MATERIAL AND METHODS}


\subsection{MATERIAL}


\subsubsection{Deterministic model for many subpopulations}

The standard SEIR model (susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered)
has been strongly developed for the dynamics of directly infectious
disease \cite{Bolker1995}. For disease-based metapopulation models,
we give here a suitable new version of the SEIR equation that would
be as follows:

Consider a metapopulation of $n$ sub-populations. In a subpopulation
$i$ of size $N_{i}$, disease dynamics can be deterministically described
by the following set of differential equations \cite{Anderson&May1992}:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\label{eq:dS}\\
\frac{dE_{i}}{dt} & = & \lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu E_{i}-\sigma E_{i}\\
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} & = & \sigma E_{i}-\mu I_{i}-\gamma I_{i}\label{eq:infectieux}\\
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}\label{eq:dR}
\end{eqnarray}
 where $S_{i}$, $E_{i}$, $I_{i}$ et $R_{i}$ are the numbers of
susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered in this sub-population
$i$ respectively. Individuals are born susceptible, die at a rate
$\mu$, become infected with the force of infection $\lambda_{i}$,
infectious after a latency period of an average duration of $1/\sigma$
and recover at the rate $\gamma$. In a case the infectious contact
rate is constant, the equilibrium values of the variables $S$, $E$,
$I$ and $R$ can be expressed analytically (see appendix). The force
of infection depends not only on the total population size $N_{i}$
and the number of infected $I_{i}$ in subpopulation $i$, but also
in other sub-populations \cite{KeelingRohani2008} :

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\sum_{j}\rho_{ij}\kappa_{j}\log\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]\label{eq:force-1}
\end{equation}
 where $c_{i,k}$ ($0\leqslant c_{ij}\leqslant1$) is the probability
that a susceptible individual native from $i$ being in contact with
another infected individual native from $k$ gets infected. $\xi_{jk}$
($0\leqslant\xi_{ij}\leqslant1$) refers to the probability that an
individual $y$ meeting $x$ in the subpopulation $C_{j}$ comes from
the subpopulation $C_{k}$. $\kappa_{j}$ is the average number of
contacts per unit of time a susceptible will have when visiting city
$j$. $\rho_{i,j}$ ($0\leqslant\rho_{ij}\leqslant1$) is denoted
as the probability that an individual from subpopulation $i$ visits
subpopulation $j$, of course, $\sum_{j=1}^{M}\rho_{ij}=1$. See appendix
for detail on the construction of this equation. We can verify that
in the limit case on one single subpopulation in the metapopulation
($i=j$ and $n=1$) we have 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=-\kappa_{i}\log(1-\frac{I_{i}}{N_{i}}\times c_{ii})
\end{equation}
 Consider that the average number of contacts per unit of time $\kappa_{i}$
is seasonally forced \cite{Altizer2006} and seasonality is an annually
periodic function of time \cite{Grenfell1995}. As a result, for the
subpopulation $i$ : 
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{i}(t)=\kappa_{i0}\left[1+\kappa_{i1}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T}+\varphi_{i}\right)\right]\label{eq:beta_i}
\end{equation}
 where $t$ is the time, $\kappa_{i0}$ and $\kappa_{i1}$ are the
mean value and amplitude of the average contact rate $\kappa_{i}$
at which a susceptible will have when visiting city $i$ per unit
of time, $T$ and $\varphi_{i}$ are the period and the phase of the
forcing. With the annual sinusoidal form of the average contact rate,
we really have the sinusoidally forced SEIR metapopulation model.


\subsubsection{Stochastic model for many subpopulations}

In order to study the extinction ability of an infectious disease
in a metapopulation, we must consider a stochastic version of the
model \cite{Keeling2002,Lloyd2001,renshaw1993modelling}. We use for
that a population-based time-to-next-event model based on Gillespie's
algorithm \cite{gillespie1977exact}. Table \ref{tab:stoch_ev} lists
all the events of the model, occurring in subpopulation $i$.

\subsubsection{Spatial structures}

A metapopulation is a population of populations (subpopulations).
Such a structure implies an heterogeneity in the sense where the probability
of contact (or contact rate) between individuals from a same subpopulation
is higher than the probability of contact between individuals of different
subpopulations \cite{Hanski2004}. Such heterogeneity is actually
the result of the interaction between two phenomena that are often
difficult to disentangle in nature. The first one relates to the granularity
of the metapopulation (as rendered by the number of and sizes of subpopulations)
and the second one relates to the isolation between subpopulations
(as can be rendered, among others, by physical distances separating
each pair of subpopulations). Moreover, according to the findings
of Benjamin Bolker (1995) \cite{Bolker1995}, there is no coexistence
between periodicity and disease persistence in non-spatial measles
models, and spatial structure is an important factor to both enhance
persistence and create new types of dynamic behaviour.

In order to identify clearly the causes of observed phenomena, these
two aspects will be modeled distinctly. In this article, our null
model (model 0) will be a metapopulation without any explicit spatial
distance (all the subpopulations are at the same distance from each
other) and where all the metapopulation have the same population size
$N$. Like the original Levins's model \cite{Levins1969}, this model
considers that all the subpopulations are at equal distance from each
other: 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}=\rho,\qquad0\leqslant\rho\leqslant1,\qquad\forall i,\forall j.
\end{equation}
 The structure of this metapopulation is thus characterized by 3 parameters:
(i) the number $n$ of sub-populations, (ii) the population size $N$
($N_{i}=N$, $\forall i$) of all these subpopulations and, (iii)
the coupling (or distance) $\rho_{ij}$ between two subpopulations
$i$ and $j$ that refers to the the probability that an individual
from subpopulation $i$ visits subpopulation $j$.


\subsection{METHOD}


\subsubsection{Stationary distribution in metapopulation}

Here we show some assumptions for the stationary distribution model
as follows :
\begin{itemize}
\item Assumption 1. For each city $V_{i}$, there exists a markov chain
$M_{i}$ describing where (i.e. in which city) individuals native
from $V_{i}$ travel at each time step. 
\item Assumption 2. Each $M_{i}$ has a stationary distribution $\rho(M_{i})$. 
\item Assumption 3. At time t=0, each agent is located in a city randomly
drawn from $\rho(M_{i})$.
\end{itemize}
When we consider a simplified model in which the dynamics of the agents
is stationary: each agent native from $V_{i}$ no more follows a markov
chain, but is relocated at each time step on a city randomly drawn
from $\rho(M_{i})$.

Then, under assumptions 1,2,3, at any time $t$, when the total number
of agents grows to infinity, the size of the populations under the
markovian dynamics converges towards the size of the populations under
stationary dynamics.

Hence, any statistics computed on the densities of agents from the
same population in various cities will not distinguish the markovian
from the stationary dynamics. 

Based on this conclusion, we will deploy a stationary distribution
in a metapopulation. First of all, we choose a population size N for
the metapopulation. Then, we compute the After that, the transition
matrix converge towards a stationary distribution matrix. Finally,
we apply the stationary distribution matrix in the metapopulation
of n subpopulations.


\subsubsection{Global persistence in a metapopulation}

In order to examine questions of interaction between disease transmissibility
and phase of seasonal forcing, we start in this section by studing
the stochastic SEIR model in a metapopualtion of $n$ subpopulations.
For this metapopulation, we observe the disease extinction in time
due to spatial synchrony/asynchrony that are influenced by phase difference
in seasonal forcing. To create the phase difference, we change the
value of the forcing phase for each subpopulation. In this experience,
we use a parameter $\varphi_{max}$ in radian that runs in the interval
from zero to $\pi$. With each value of $\varphi_{max}$, based on
$n$ the number of subpopulations in the metapopulation, we divide
the interval {[}0, $\varphi_{max}${]} into a set of $(n-1)$ equal
samples, so the value of the forcing phase of the $i^{th}$ subpopulation
is correspondent to $i^{th}$ value in the set. We call $\varphi_{max}$
asynchrony parameter.

The persistence of disease in the metapopulation was characterized
by fitting an exponential survival model \cite{Conlan2010,Kleinbaum2005}
on a data simulated by a stochastic model. To measure the persistence
in ecology and epidemiology, so many methods we can use \cite{Conlan2010,Gunning2013,Keeling2002}.
For example, Keeling et al.(2002) \cite{Keeling2002} gave two methods.
One method was for an isolated metapopulation without migration by
calculating the expected extinction time or the extinction rate during
a given period. This was a theoretical measure as no real data exists
to compare with model results. The other method for a population with
migration was found by calculating the number or the total duration
of extinctions. Then in 2010, ``mean annual fade-out'' and ``fade-outs
post epidemic'' methods proposed by Conlan \cite{Conlan2010} were
used to quantify persistence by basing on the proportion or on the
frequency of zero reports in a given reporting interval. For our metapopulation
of $n$ subpopulations, to do so we run first $m$ independent simulations
of our stochastic model. We calculate then the average metapopulation
size by summing subpopulations at each sample time and averaging across
the entire time series for each metapopulation. Lastly, we record
the dates $t$ of global disease extinction in all these $m$ metapopulations.
These dates allow to draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves from which
we estimate the global extinction rates $\chi$: 
\begin{equation}
M(t)=\exp(-\chi t)
\end{equation}
 where $M(t)$ ($0\leqslant M(t)\leqslant m$) is the number of metapopulations
in which the disease is not extinct at time $t$.

To assess global extinction rate as well as global persistence level
in metapopulation, here, we use the parametric survival model for
the exponential distribution (R package '$survival$' \cite{survival-package}).
Due to that, we can capture one of the most important features of
stochastic systems in spatial structure : its global extinction characteristics
of disease.

Besides, to compute local extinction rate that illustrates the probability
of local extinction event in the duration of fluctuations in incidence.
We save up all disease duration in all subpopulations of the metapopulation.
We consider the data array like a Poisson process and we estimate
local extinction rate from this data.


\subsubsection{Characterization of synchrony}

Call $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}$ ($0\leqslant\delta_{ij}<2\pi$) the
phase difference between subpopulations $i$ and $j$ : 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{ij}=|\varphi_{i}-\varphi_{j}|\bmod2\pi
\end{equation}
 where $\varphi{}_{i}$ and $\varphi{}_{j}$ are the phases of the
contact rates (equation \ref{eq:beta_i}) in subpopulations $i$ et
$j$. Populations $i$ and $j$ are perfectly in phase if $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}=0$
or $2\pi$ and in opposition of phase if $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}=\pi$.
We can thus define the degree of synchrony $\xi_{ij}=\xi_{ji}$ ($0\leqslant\xi_{ij}\leqslant1$)
between populations $i$ and $j$ as 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{ij}=\left|1-\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\pi}\right|.
\end{equation}
 
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centering \includegraphics{figure/figure1} \caption{\label{fig:synchrony-1}Synchrony in the case of model 0. (A) distribution
of synchrony $\xi_{ij}$ for various values of $\varphi_{max}$. (B)
mean and standard deviation of the distribution of $\xi_{ij}$ as
functions of $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$.}
\end{figure}


Consider that in the metapopulation the phases $\varphi_{i}$ of the
contact rates in the $n$ subpopulations are evenly distributed between
0 and $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$ ($0\leqslant\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\leqslant\pi$).
We can express the mean of the pairwise phase differences $\delta_{ij}=\delta_{ji}$
as 
\begin{equation}
<\!\!\delta_{ij}\!\!>\;=\;<\!\!\delta_{ji}\!\!>\;=2\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{(n-k)k}{(n-1)n^{2}}=\frac{n+1}{3n}\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}
\end{equation}
 and thus the mean of the synchronies $\xi_{ij}=\xi_{ji}$ as 
\begin{equation}
<\!\!\xi_{ij}\!\!>\;=\;<\!\!\xi_{ji}\!\!>\;=1-\frac{n+1}{3n}\frac{\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}}{\pi}
\end{equation}
 and thus 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty}<\!\!\xi_{ij}\!\!>\;=1-\frac{\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}}{3\pi}
\end{equation}


This last result shows that, for a high enough number $n$ of subpopulations,
the mean value of the $\xi_{ij}$ does not depend on the number of
subpopulation.

The values of $\varphi_{i}$ are chosen so that they are uniformly
distributed between $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny min}}=0$ and $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$.
The distribution of $\xi_{ij}$ doesn't depend on $n$ the number
of subpopulation, but only depends $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$ and
may be is characterized by one single parameter (we choose the average
value of all $\xi_{ij}$), view figure \ref{fig:synchrony-1}.


\section{RESULT}


\subsection{Influence of the number of subpopulations on the local extinction
rate in the coupled model}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure/figEXTMETARho0\lyxdot 1N1e6}

\caption{Influence of the number of subpopulations on the local extinction

\label{figInflNubPOP}
\end{figure}


As shown in Fig \ref{figInflNubPOP}, there is a good agreement between
simulations and analytic results for the synchronization and phase
lag between subpopulations in the metapopulation. We implemented the
simulation for the SEIR metapopulation model of subpopulations coupled
by individual movement with time-varying periodic contact rate. The
result shows that the local extinction rate of the synchronization
is larger than the one of the asynchronization, and the number of
subpopulations in the metapopulation strongly affects the local extinction
rate. 

In order to investigate the dependence among subpopulations, we set
the coupling interaction $\rho\neq0$. Besides, $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$
is an important parameter which clearly reflects the difference between
subpopulation's phases. With the decreasing of $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$,
we increase the similarity between sub-populations, but we limit the
chances of re-colonizations within subpopulations. The reason for
this adjustment is that there is more chance that a small number of
incidences may occur in nearby subpopulations when the focal subpopulation
has reached extinction.

To obtain the synchrony in the metapopulation, we set $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=0$.
The subpopulations are grouped into pairs based on their interactions,
and particularly their disease phases are in-phase. All the subpopulations
are in synchrony. So the ability of rescue effect among subpopulations
are small, they simply get extinct. Consequently, the local extinction
rate when $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$ equal $0$ is higher than
the rest. On the other hand, the asynchrony is presented by $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\neq0$.
The disease phases in the coupled subpopulations are out of phase,
the synchrony is interrupted. With $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=\pi$,
the decreased similarity between sub-populations leads an increase
of the chance of recolonization among sub-populations. A sub-population
has even reached the local extinction, but the disease comes easily
back due to the recolonization among sub-populations. Hence, the local
extinction rate in the case $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}\neq0$ is
lower. Briefly, the local extinction rate of the synchrony is better
than that of the asynchrony.

In addition, in order to study the influence of the number of subpopulation
on the extinction rate. In our experience, the number of subpopulations
is modified from $1$ to $30$. In the case of Fig \ref{figInflNubPOP},
the local extinction rate significantly increases when subpopulations
are asynchronous as well as synchronous. This extinction rate increases
with the number of subpopulations. However, it seems that this increase
is stagnating after it reaches the peak of extinction, and even it
starts decreasing after this peak. To explain this change of these
curves, we known that the parameters (the metapopulation size $N$,
the number of subpopulation $n$ and the phase difference $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$),
are three important factors that make the local extinction curve be
divided into 3 parts. 

For the first part, the curves are climbed. As, we fixed the values
of the metapopulation and $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$. Hence, when
the number of subpopulation is small (less than $20$). For the fixed
metapopulation size, the increase of the number of subpopulation from
$1$ to $20$ leads a decrease of the subpopulation size. The size
of each subpopulation is reduced, but this reduce is negligible, the
number of native individual in any subpopulation is much larger than
that of tourists, so we do not regard the effect of the decreased
subpopulation size on the extinction rate. It is the reason for why
$\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$ clearly demonstrates its influence on
the local extinction of the metapopulation. Thus, we increase the
number of subpopulations in the metapopulation, we increase the chance
of displacement and recolonization among subpopulations. In addition,
for a given $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$, the increase of the number
of subpopulations makes subpopulations be more similar. The result
is that the local extinction rate has the tendency to augment. 

On the other hand, when the number of subpopulation is large (larger
than $20$). With the fixed value $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}$, the
increase of the the number of subpopulation makes the subpopulations
have the tendency to resemble. Then, the subpopulations are in phase
of disease. It is the reason why in this case the size of subpopulations
strongly affects the local extinction rate. The number of subpopulation
is large. The size of each subpopulation is small. According to a
sub-population, its size is small, but the sum of the size of the
neighbors is large, the number of tourists visiting this subpopulation
is high. So when the number of subpopulation is big from $20$ to
$26$, the local extinction rate decreases. In the final part of the
curve, when the number of sub-population is too large, then both the
sub-populations are in synchrony, and the subpopulation size is very
small. Therefore, the local extinction rate increases.


\subsection{Influence of the number of subpopulations on the local extinction
rate in the island model}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure/res1METAExtSansForc} \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure/res1METARecolSansForc}\label{figInfNbPOPIslandModel_b}

\label{figInfNbPOPIslandModel_a}

\caption{Influence of the number of subpopulations on the local extinction
rate in the island model}


\label{figInfNbPOPIslandModel}
\end{figure}


In this experience, we are interested in the influence of the number
of subpopulations on the the local extinction rate for the standard
SEIR model without forcing. This simple metapopulation model just
investigates subpopulations connected by individual movement without
environmental transmission. The average number of contacts per unit
of time of a susceptible when visiting another subpopulation is fixed
as a constant. The strength of connection $\rho$ is set to $0$ for
the model of isolated subpopulations (island model) and different
from $0$ for the model of coupled subpopulations (coupling model).
Hence, in this case, the main factor affecting the extinction rate
is the migration of individuals rather any environmental factor. 

The result shown in the Fig \ref{figInfNbPOPIslandModel_a} points
out that in the isolation model with the fixed metapopulation size,
the increased number of subpopulations leads to a decrease of the
subpopulation size. This limits the ability of the rescue effect to
ensure locally extinct subpopulations become recolonized. Hence the
local extinction rate rises significantly. Besides that, due to the
disjunction among subpopulations in the metapopulation, a subpopulation
will obtain the global extinction immediately after it get the first
local extinction, so any there won't be any recolonization occurs
in this island model. The recolonization rate is zero in all cases
as shown in the Fig \ref{figInfNbPOPIslandModel_b}. 

Inverse to the coupled model, the strength of interaction between
the two subpopulations have clearly demonstrated its influence on
the extinction ability in metapopulation. The curve of the coupled
case will be increased notably when the number of subpopulation extends
in the range from $1$ to $20$. As explained in above obtained results
of the Fig \ref{figInflNubPOP}, although the number of subpopulation
augments but is still small, the number of native individuals in a
subpopulation is much larger than the number of tourists in any specific
time. Thus, for the fixed metapopulation size, the increased number
of subpopulations draws a decline of the subpopulation size. The disease
of subpopulation easily get extinct, whenever the local extinction
rate augments. However, when the number of subpopulation becomes a
large number, then the subpopulation size becomes really small, but
the number of neighbours is big. Therefore, the number of native individuals
is much smaller than that of tourists, so the tourists arrive and
continue to transmit disease within the subpopulation. Hence, the
local extinction rate has a significant decline. As pointed out in
the Fig \ref{figInfNbPOPIslandModel_b}, the recolonization rate has
the same form to the local extinction rate. 


\subsection{Influence of the coupling strength on the local extinction rate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure/figCoupleMETA}

\caption{Influence of the coupling strength on the local extinction rate of
the metapopulation of 4 subpopulations with the metapopulation size
$N=1e6$}


\label{figCoupleMETA}

\end{figure}


One more factor that was pointed in the introduction part is coupling
strength between subpopulations. Here, the coupling rate or the dispersal
rate $\rho$ can be considered as migration strength. The disease
transmission speed grows fast when coupling rate goes up in metapopulations.
Similar to that, global disease persistence surges also. In this part,
we permit coupling rate change from weak to strong in a metapopulation
of five subpopulations with the population size $N=1e6$ for each
subpopulation. The dispersal rate $\rho$ is divided into three intervals.
These are low, intermediate and high coupling rate intervals. In each
interval, we chose some coupling rates that highlight the coupling
strength among subpopulations in a metapopulation. With each value
of coupling rate, we estimated local extinction rate that presents
the extinction probability of disease in a subpopulation. We have
result as following figure Fig \ref{figCoupleMETA}. 

When the coupling rate is small from $0.0$ to $0.001$, the locale
extinction rate significantly decreases. However, this rate is minimum
when the coupling rate has medium values from$0.001$ to $0.1$. Lastly,
the extinction rate augments back when the coupling rate is very strong
from $0.1$ to $0.5$. As shown in the Fig \ref{figCoupleMETA}, the
local extinction rate in a metapopulation is one humped function for
the coupling rate. The medium coupling rate (from $0.01$ to $0.1$)
minimises the extinction rate of disease in metapopulation. Because
in the case of the small and medium coupling rates, the coupling rate
and the speed of migration among subpopulations are directly proportional.
The dispersal speed increases. Thereby the local recolonization speed
rises, the duration of persistence grows, the local extinction rate
goes down. However, this trend of local extinction with decreasing
coupling rate, is not right any more when the dispersal rate is strong.
The metapopulation has tendency to become one big population. In this
case, the phase difference or the recolonization among subpopulations
are no longer significant. Hence, the local extinction rate rises. 




\section{DISCUSSION}

We successfully have built a version for the susceptible-infected-recovered
stochastic metapopulation model (subpopulations connected by individual
movement), which describes both movement-based and environmental transmission.
The infection rate $\lambda_{i}$ for $subpopulation_{i}$ has portrayed
all effects inside as well as outside of the disease tranmission chain
between individuals in the same subpopulation or in other subpopulations.
Moreover, our metapopulation model became more detailed when we brought
seasonality in metapopulation model to create periodic transmission
in year that highlighted seasonal changes as well as school period
of children \cite{Bolker1993,Bolker1995,Earn1998,Keeling2002}. We
have metapopulation model with different contact rates for each subpopulation.
This is a more complex model than any used metapopulation model. We
have sketched successfully in-phase and sometime out-of-phase (``antiphase'')
models across suburbs of He's 2003 \cite{He2003}.

This complex metapopulation model is also an expected result of Rozhnova(2012)
\cite{Rozhnova2012}. It's a good result for scientists wanting to
use the SEIR metapopulation model for simulating dynamics of infectious
diseases. Our results roughly support those of Rozhnova's 2012. The
authors gave different values of the contact rates $\beta$ of each
subpopulation. However, the rates $\beta$ here are fixed by constants
and the number of subpopulations in experiences are maximum of three.
Comparing this result with our's, in a coupling metapopulation, the
degree of synchorny is maintained when the coupling rate between subpopulations
is weak.

Moreover, our stochastic SEIR metapopulation model with subpopulations
connected to each other, we have quantified disease extinction of
seasonality as well as spatial synchrony. With our model, we can easily
create level of seasonality in year and at the same time, phase difference
in seasonality between subpopulations. It's the reason why we have
model quite close to the metapopulation model in reality.

Due to the phase difference between infection coefficient $\beta$,
we can change by an increase or a decrease in level of synchrony.
We want to decrease level of synchrony, by simply increasing the phase
difference between forcing phase coefficients in the formulas of contact
rate $\beta$. Clearly, the level of synchrony between two subpopulations
are the worst when the two fluctuations are in antiphase (as figure
\ref{figInflNubPOP}). When the phase difference between oscillations
increases, the desynchronizing effect on population dynamics of the
subpopulations augments. This declines the ability of disease extinction.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figure/resGlobExt3}

\caption{Quantifing the global extinction rate in the metapopulation. The number
of subpopulation $n$ from $1$ to $25$, the metapopulation size
$N=1e6$ and the coupling rate $\rho=0.1$. As this result, the global
extinction rate of the synchrony with $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=0$
has the tendance to be larger than that of the asynchrony with $\varphi_{\mbox{\tiny max}}=\pi$.
Besides, when the number of subpopulation slowly increases from $1$
to $15$, the subpopulation size has a decrease, but this decrease
is very small, the subpopulation size is still very big. Hence, the
red curve of the synchrony and the blue curve of the asynchrony have
a quite near resemblance. Inversely, the global extinction rate strongly
augments when the number of subpopulation is quite big from $20$.
The increased number of subpopulation leads to strongly decline the
subpopulation size. This drives quite the decrease global persitence
time of the metapopualtion, so the mass extinction rate of the metapopulation
increases significantly.}


\label{figMassExt}
\end{figure}


Moreover, as the result above (figure \ref{figInfNbPOPIslandModel})
and the global extinction rate below (figure \ref{figMassExt}), our
results, along with those of Bolker (1995) \cite{Bolker1995} and
Heino (1997) \cite{Heino1997}, stress the local extinction rate being
inversely proportionnel with the global extinction rate in a metapopulation.
When the level of synchrony is at a reduction and the global persistence
time gets an increase, the global extinction rate of metapopulation
goes down and the local extinction rate goes up. Due to the result
about local extinction, we also affirm that disease is always available
in metapopulation if and only if at least one subpopulaiton is not
extinct. 

Our finding has specified the two main factors influencing the persistence
ability of an infectious disease. One factor is transmission characteristics
of the infectious disease and the other is interplay between mixing
subpopulations in metapopulation. The interaction between the disease
persistence and the spatial heterogeneity becomes a major key to unlock
questions about infectious disease in epidemiology. This result takes
a large part in epidemic disease persistence domain that has being
exploited in scientific epidemically research works. We gained a robust
understanding of how disease extinction is affected by local factors
such as spatial heterogeneity, demographic asynchrony and seasonality,
as well as mixing factors such as migration, disease transmission
between hosts and pathogens. Lastly, we also highlighted recolonization
effects. It is like rescue for disease. Because of connection between
subpopulation, individuals can go everywhere. Subpopulation is quickly
re-infected althought the disease has became extinct. Thus, the disease
rescus makes local extintions difficult to extend into global extinctions.

As a matter of the fact of coupling strength among subpopulations
in metapopulation, we proved that\textbf{ }the extinction of the disease
in the metapopulation is not only computed by a exponential survival
function over time, but also a concave function for the coupling rate.
In addition, the disease extinction in metapopulation is minimum when
the coupling rate between subpopulations is just medium. This finding
is similar to those of Huffaker(1958) \cite{huffaker1958experimental},
Holyoak and Lawler(1996) \cite{holyoak1996persistence}, and Yaari
et al. (2012) \cite{Yaari2012} when they exhaustively explored the
disease persistence behavior of many different metapopulation models.
And our result one more time affirms that the disease persistence
and the interaction in metapopulation models are significant when\textbf{
}the interaction strength $\rho$ is from $10^{-3}$ to 0.1 \cite{KeelingRohani2008}.

To summarize, we have built successfully a\textbf{ }sinusoidally forced
SEIR stochastic metapopulation model. This model is like a physical
system of coupled oscillators. We have pointed out that spatial synchronization
consistently and predictably makes extinction risk increase by using
the model $0$ where all the subpopulations have the same population
size $N$ and there is no explicit spatial distance. So, it's good
for the future, we can continue this work with different population
size of each subpopulation and different spatial distance between
subpopulations and then, create synchronous metapopulations that optimize
vaccination policies.

\section{Appendix : equilibrium values of the system \ref{eq:dS}--\ref{eq:dR}}

We start with ordinary differential equations for a $subpopulation_{i}$
in a metapopulation as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\\
\frac{dE_{i}}{dt} & = & \lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu E_{i}-\sigma E_{i}\\
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} & = & \sigma E_{i}-\mu I_{i}-\gamma I_{i}\\
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}
\end{eqnarray}
 In simulation, we know that the equilibrium state allow a disease
to persist in a population for a long time. So, an infectious disease
in the $subpopulation_{i}$ is available in long term this system
is at equilibrium. It means that at which $\frac{dS_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dI{}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dR{}_{i}}{dt}=0$
({*}). Thus, we let all equations (equations $15$ - $18$ ) in the
system be equal to zero, then calculate the values of the variables
(now denoted by $S_{i}^{*}$, $E_{i}^{*}$, $I_{i}^{*}$ , and $R{}_{i}^{*}$)
that satisfy this condition ({*}). We have these values as folllows:

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}{\beta\sigma}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma+\mu}-\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta\sigma}\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\frac{\beta\sigma-(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}{\beta(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}


Here, if we set $R_{0}=\frac{\beta\sigma}{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}$,
so we have

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}


One nomal conditions for all population availabes is that the equilibrium
values cannot be negative. Therefore, an infectious disease is available
in the $subpopulation_{i}$ if $R_{0}>1$. Now, the endemic equilibrium
in the system is given by $(S_{i}^{*},E_{i}^{*},I{}_{i}^{*},R{}_{i}^{*})$
= $(N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}$, $N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)$,
$N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)$, $N_{i}(1-\frac{1}{R_{0}}-\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)-\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1))$.


\section{Appendix: derivation of the equation \ref{eq:force-1}}

Here, we will point out that the contact rate $\beta$ is a function
of the average contact number per unit of time and the probability
of successful disease transmission following a contact.
\begin{defn}
During the small time interval $\delta t$, each individual native
of the city $i$ visits one single city\textbf{ }$j$ (with the probability
$\rho_{ij}$) and will see in average $\kappa_{j}$ individuals. These
individuals come from all the cities.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Notation :}

Here, we present list of sets and events describing the state of the
system at time $t$ : 
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{i}$ is the set of all individuals born in subpopulation $i$. 
\item $V_{i,t}$ is the set of all individuals physically located in subpopulation
$i$ from time $t$ to time $t+\delta t$. This includes foreigners
traveling in subpopulation $i$ at time $t$, and all natives from
subpopulation $i$ which are not traveling abroad at time $t$. 
\item $S_{t},E_{t},I_{t},R_{t}$ are the sets of all individuals respectively
susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered at time $t$. Note that
these set include individuals from all subpopulations. 
\item $S_{i,t},E_{i,t},I_{i,t},R_{i,t}$ are the same sets, restricted to
natives of subpopulation $i$. So formally, $S_{i,t}=S_{t}\cap C_{i}$,
$E_{i,t}=E_{t}\cap C_{i}$, $I_{i,t}=I_{t}\cap C_{i}$, and $R_{i,t}=R_{t}\cap C_{i}$. 
\item $Transmit(y,x)$ is an event indicating that individual $x$ gets
infected by individual $y$ which was already infected 
\item $c_{i,k}$ is the probability that a susceptible individual native
from $i$ being in contact with another infected individual native
from $k$ gets infected. 
\item $\kappa_{j}$ is the average number of contacts per unit of time a
susceptible will have when visiting city $j$. 
\item $\xi_{jk}$ refers to the probability that an individual $y$ meeting
$x$ in $C_{j}$ comes from $C_{k}$.
\item $\rho_{i,j}$, the probability that an individual from subpopulation
$i$ visits subpopulation $j$. Of course, $\sum_{j=1}^{M}\rho_{ij}=1$.\end{itemize}
\begin{prop}
The coefficient $\kappa$ should also depend on $i$, because an individual
native from city $i$ meets more people in his own city than abroad
($\kappa_{i,i}>\kappa_{i,j}$). 
\end{prop}

\subsection{The background}

One general question is always posed ``how does the population of
exposed individuals of subpopulation $i$ evolve ?''. For the sake
of simplicity, in the process of transmission of the SEIR model, we
focus on the incidence and we assume for now that the latent period
and the recovery rate, repectively $\mu=\sigma=0$. Thus, we write
a probabilistic formulation of $\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}$. Assuming the
time is discrete, we have $\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}\approx\mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\setminus E_{i,t}\right]$.
Then,

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\setminus E_{i,t}\right] & = & \mathbb{E}\left[E_{i,t+1}\cap S_{i,t}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{x\in C_{i}}Pr\left[x\in E_{t+1}\wedge x\in S_{t}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{x\in C_{i}}Pr\left[x\in S_{t}\right]*Pr\left[x\in E_{t+1}\mid x\in S_{t}\right]\\
 & = & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+1}\mid x\in S_{t}\right]*\sum_{x\in C_{i}}Pr\left[x\in S_{t}\right]\\
 & = & |S_{i,t}|\times Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+1}\mid x\in S_{t}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}


Assume there are $M$ cities. An individual $x$ of the subpopulation
$i$ may be visiting another subpopulation, or staying in its own
subpopulation. Applying the law of total probabilities, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\mid x\in S_{t}\right] & = & \sum_{j=1}^{M}Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\mid x\in S_{t}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{j=1}^{M}Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right].Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 &  & \sum_{j=1}^{M}Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\times\rho_{ij}
\end{eqnarray*}


Where $\rho_{i,j}=Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in V_{j,t}\right]$,
the probability that an individual from subpopulation $i$ visits
subpopulation $j$. Of course, $\sum_{j=1}^{M}\rho_{ij}=1$.


\subsection{Study of case where agent $x$ native from city $i$ visits city
$j$}

Here, we look at the probability that a susceptible $x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}$
visiting $j$ gets infected or not after $\delta t$ time steps. Let
$\mathcal{Y}$ be the uniform distribution over $V_{j,t}$. The correct
mathematical approach for this would be to assume that for each city
$k$, the number of people native from $k$ that we meet during $\delta t$
follows a Poisson process. So both the number of people we meet and
the number of infected people we meet during $\delta t$ should be
random variables.

In the approach described in \cite{KeelingRohani2008}, the authors
did not do this. They assumed that both the number of people we meet
and the number of infected people we meet \emph{are fixed} (otherwise
the maths they write would have been different). We will call this
the ``Keeling \& Rohani'' interpretation that we will present it
in the following parts.

We introduce an alternative approximation, where we assume that the
number $\kappa$ of people we meet during $\delta t$ is \emph{fixed},
but each of these people has \emph{some probability} to be infected.
This is an \emph{in-between interpretation}, easier than the Poisson
process maths, but better than Keeling\&Rohani's one. We will call
this the ``Yann-Giang'' interpretation.


\subsubsection{The ``Yann-Giang'' interpretation}
\begin{prop}
Agent $x$ meets \emph{exactly} $\kappa_{j}$ other individuals, and
each of these individuals has a probability $\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}$
of being infected, where $k$ is its native city. Let $y_{1}\ldots y_{\kappa_{j}}$
be the individuals that $x$ meets. We get:
\end{prop}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in S_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y_{1}\ldots,y_{\kappa_{j}}\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left[\bigwedge_{p=1}^{\kappa_{j}}\neg\left(y_{p}\in I_{t}\wedge Transmit(y_{p},x)\right)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}


So we have:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in S_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left[\neg\left(y\in I_{t}\wedge Transmit(y,x)\right)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]^{\kappa_{j}\delta t}
\end{eqnarray*}


Moreover, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item the probability so that a susceptible individual $x$ is infected
by an infected individual $y$ :
\end{itemize}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left[y\in I_{t}\wedge Transmit(y,x)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{M}Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left[y\in I_{t}\wedge Transmit(y,x)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\wedge y\in C_{k}\right].Pr_{y\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left(y\in C_{k}\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{M}\left\{ Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y\sim\mathcal{X}_{k}}\left[y\in I_{t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\right.\\
 &  & \,\,\,\,\,\left.\times Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i},y\sim\mathcal{X}_{k}}\left[Transmit(y,x)\mid y\in I_{t}\wedge x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\wedge y\in C_{k}\right]\times Pr_{y\sim\mathcal{Y}}\left(y\in C_{k}\right)\right\} \\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}


$\xi_{jk}=\frac{N_{k}\rho_{kj}}{\sum_{v=1}^{M}N_{v}\rho_{vj}}$ refers
to the probability that an individual $y$ meeting $x$ in $C_{j}$
comes from $C_{k}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item hence, the probability so that a susceptible individual $x$ is not
infected by an infected individual $y$ :
\end{itemize}
\[
1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item thereby, the probability so that a susceptible individual $x$ is
not infected after $\kappa_{j}$ contacts per unit time $\delta t$.
\end{itemize}
\[
\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]^{\kappa_{j}\delta t}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item thus, the probability so that a susceptible individual $x$ becomes
infected after $\kappa_{j}$ contacts per unit time $\delta t$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & = & \left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]^{\kappa_{j}\delta t}
\end{eqnarray*}


We now apply the \emph{log} approximation which consists in approximating
$1-(1-u)^{v}$ by $v\log(1-u)$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & = & -\kappa_{j}\delta t\log\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]
\end{eqnarray*}


So, the transmission rate per susceptible individual is as follows
:

\[
\frac{dPr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]}{dt}\simeq-\kappa_{j}\log\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]
\]


In fact, we use the parameter $\lambda$ to present this quantity,
and it is denoted as the ``force of infection'' :

\[
\lambda_{i}=\sum_{j}\rho_{ij}\kappa_{j}\log\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]
\]


If there is only one city $i$, then

\[
\lambda_{i}=\kappa_{j}log(1-\frac{\left|I_{i}\right|}{N_{i}}\times c_{ii})
\]



\subsubsection{``Keeling \& Rohani'' Interpretation}
\begin{prop}
Agent $x$ meets \emph{exactly} $\kappa_{j}\delta t\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}$
other infected individuals native from city $k$.

Let $l_{k}=\kappa_{j}\delta t\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}$. 


Let $y_{1}^{k}\ldots y_{l_{k}}^{k}$ be the infected individuals native
from $k$ that our individual $x$ meets between $t$ and $t+\delta t$.

\end{prop}
We have the probability so that a susceptible individual $x$ is not
infected after having seen $l_{k}$ individuals between $t$ and $t+\delta t$
:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in S_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[\bigwedge_{\begin{array}{c}
k=1\ldots M\\
p=1\ldots l_{k}
\end{array}}\neg\left(Transmit(y_{p}^{k},x)\right)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & \prod_{k=1}^{M}Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[\bigwedge_{p=1\ldots l_{k}}\neg\left(Transmit(y_{p}^{k},x)\right)\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]\\
 & = & \prod_{k=1}^{M}\left(1-c_{ik}\right)^{\kappa_{j}\delta t\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}}
\end{eqnarray*}


Then, we plug this back into the previous formula, and we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & = & 1-\prod_{k=1}^{M}\left(1-c_{ik}\right)^{\kappa_{j}\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\delta t}
\end{eqnarray*}


The first order approximation of $1-\prod_{k=1}^{M}(1-c_{ik})^{v_{k}}$
is $\sum_{k=1}^{M}-v_{k}\log(1-c_{ik})$. Applying this approximation
here, we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+\delta t}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right] & \simeq & \delta t\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(-\kappa_{j}\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\log\left(1-c_{ik}\right)\right)
\end{eqnarray*}


Define $\beta_{ijk}=-\kappa_{j}\log\left(1-c_{ik}\right)$, let $\delta t$
converge to zero, and we get:

\[
\frac{dPr_{x\sim\mathcal{X}_{i}}\left[x\in E_{t+dt}\mid x\in S_{t}\wedge x\in V_{j,t}\right]}{dt}\simeq\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\beta_{ijk}\right)
\]


If there is only one city $i$, then we fall back to the formula of
\cite{KeelingRohani2008}. We have : 

\[
\beta_{i}=-\kappa_{i}\log\left(1-c_{i}\right)
\]


\[
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbb{E}\left[\left|E_{i,t+dt}-E_{i,t}\right|\right]\simeq-\left|S_{i,t}\right|\left(\frac{\left|I_{i}\right|}{N_{i}}\beta_{i}\right)
\]


and the force of infection as follows :

\[
\lambda_{i}=\beta_{i}\frac{\left|I_{i}\right|}{N_{i}}
\]



\subsection{Final Formula}

We simply have to plug in the probability $\rho_{ij}$ that $i$ visits
$j$.

We get, for the ``Yann-Giang'' interpretation :

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbb{E}\left[\left|E_{i,t+dt}-E_{i,t}\right|\right]\simeq-\left|S_{i,t}\right|\sum_{j}\rho_{ij}\kappa_{j}\log\left[1-\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\times c_{ik}\times\xi_{jk}\right)\right]
\]


And for the ``Keeling \& Rohani'' Interpretation :

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbb{E}\left[\left|E_{i,t+dt}-E_{i,t}\right|\right]\simeq-\left|S_{i,t}\right|\sum_{j}\rho_{ij}\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(\xi_{jk}\frac{\left|I_{k,t}\right|}{N_{k}}\beta_{ijk}\right)
\]
