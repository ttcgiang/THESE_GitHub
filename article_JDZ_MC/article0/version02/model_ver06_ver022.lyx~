Quantifying the effect of synchrony on the persistence of infectious diseases
 in a metapopulation

\begin_layout Abstract
Global persistence of infectious diseases is a big problem for epidemiologists.
 Studies have showed that there are a lot of reasons to answer why many
 communicable diseases still exist and have been developed in more dangerous
 form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The asynchrony and the recolonization among subpopulations are two key
 reasons pointed out.
 However, why these are the asynchrony and the recolonozations in a metapopulati
on is still an open question.
 Here we study the combined effects of forcing phase heterogeneity in the
 seasonally forced contact rate on global persistence of disease.
 We carry out an exploitation of stochastic dynamics in a susceptible-exposed-in
fectious-recovered (SEIR) model of the spread of infectious diseases in
 a metapopulation of n subpopulations.
 Starting with continuous-time Markov description of the model of deterministic
 equation, the direct method of Gillespie(1977) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1977exact"

\end_inset

 in the class of Monte-Carlo simulation methods allows us to simulate exactly
 the spread of disease with the SEIR model.
 Our finding of the exploitation of stochastic dynamics points out that
 the persistence of the disease in the meta-population is characterized
 as an exponential survival model on data simulated by the stochastic model.
 Using a parametric survival model for an exponential distribution (R package
 'survival' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "survival-package"

\end_inset

), we estimate the global extinction rate which represents the global persistenc
e of disease in the meta-population.
 We find how bigger the forcing phase heterogeneity becomes, and how larger
 the global persistence gets.

INTRODUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
News about infectious diseases has always been a subject of worry to parents
 as well as all.
 It has brought many problems to humain society.
 Recent works have shown that infectious diseases do spread in space 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Cumming2004,Grenfell2001,Smith2004,viboud2006synchrony"

\end_inset

.
 The exact form of disease movement depends on a number of local factors
 (demographic including population size 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004"

\end_inset

, growth rate and death rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2007"

\end_inset

, sociological such as school period of children, work tendency from rural
 to urban, environmental and climatic comprising seasonal variations in
 seasonality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010,Griffen2009"

\end_inset

, temperature and rainfall, immunological for diseases, etc...) as well as
 the connections between the different populations (i.e.
 spatial structure) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yan2007"

\end_inset

 such as distance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004"

\end_inset

, coupling rate, number of individuals between populations, etc....Hence, we
 focus on spread of disease in space by using variations in the seasonal
 aspects of subpopulations and after examine how synchrony could affect
 the persistence of infectious diseases in a metapopulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In modeling of ecological system, presenting interactions between humans,
 subpopulations, geographic conditions and the metapopulation model is a
 good choice.
 Metapopulation is a set of subpopulations with mutual interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

 here a subpopulation can only go extinct locally and be recolonized by
 another after it is emptied by extinction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hanski1998,Levins1969"

\end_inset

.
 It is the reason that the ecological theory of metapopualtion can point
 out that the persistence of a population depends on the dynamics of migrations
 between the different sub-populations of the metapopualtion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004,Hanski1998,Hanski2004,Levins1969"

\end_inset

.
 The “colonization” caused by migrations brings infection to an uninfected
 subpopulation and we call infected individuals colonizers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the disease persistence capability in a metapopulation depends
 positively on level of asynchrony between subpopulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hagenaars2004,Heino1997"

\end_inset

.
 Many studies showed that the asynchronization of epidemics among subpopulations
 causes the recolonization of diseases for locally extinct subpopulation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hagenaars2004,Hanski1998,Heino1997,Yaari2012"

\end_inset

.
 So, the recolonization becomes the main reason for which disease persistence
 exists.
 The disease always appears in metapopulation if and only if there is at
 least one non-extinct subpopulation.

in order to explain why measles persists after lot of vaccination policies,
 Bolker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 used the measles data before and after vaccination from 1964 to 1988 in
 England and Wales.
 Vaccination has broken high synchrony between the UK cities in prevaccination
 era, and at the same time, causes decorrelation and enhances global persistence
 of the infection, because of decorrelating factors of vaccination such
 as the starting moment of vaccination policies, number of susceptibles
 vaccinated and interaction between vaccination policies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A decrease in correlation between subpopulations may make a metapopulation
 more difficult to eradicate infectious diseases
\series bold
 
\series default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Earn1998"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the level of synchrony between the subpopulations is strongly
 governed by the migration rate and distances between them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heino1997"

\end_inset

.
 In our modern world, the distance problem isn't large anymore for individuals
 who want to travel.
 There are a lot of cities very remote, but very connected, and thus very
 synchronous as in the USA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Choisy2012"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, migration among subpopulations has become a big problem.
 The disease synchrony speed within a metapopulation can strongly increase
 when migration rate there is strong 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KeelingRohani2008"

\end_inset

.

\series bold

The migration rates are directly proportional to the amount of variation
 in metapopulation size, but inversely to the amount of variation in subpopulati
on size, over time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dey2006,Griffen2009"

\end_inset

.
 So, migration is key to the recolonization of empty subpopulation and simultane
ously increases the degree of synchrony between subpopulations in spatially
 structured metapopulation.
 However, the vast majority of infectious diseases control policies that
 are applied in the world are still based on rationales that do not consider
 the local extinction/recolonization dynamics.
 This is maybe a reason why measles persists

 For example, in the start of the 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO)
 had officially stated the global measles epidemic outbreak.
 In the first three months of the year 2014, there were about 56,000 cases
 of measle infections in 75 countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WHO2014a"

\end_inset

, including countries in south-east Asia and most particularly, Vietnam
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We discovered measles persistence in the world for many years without extinctio
n, from one nation to another as well as from cities to other cities.
 Though the moment of disease outbreaks in each region differs.
 For neighbouring regions with disease persistence, there is a time-lag
 differs between disease outbreak.
 This is explained in sociology by difference in culture, in geographic
 condition and more particularly seasonality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seasonality has been one in rather robust ingredients influencing the disease
 persistence process.
 Seasonal changes can alter migration tendency between urban and rural areas
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ferrari2010"

\end_inset

, also residence time of hosts, vectors and pathogens.
 Seasonal variation can thus determine population size, migration and interactio
n capabilities and particularly infection rate at which susceptible individuals
 become infected 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Altizer2006,Hosseini2004"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, infectious disease outbreak occurs due to this infection rate.
 However, finding a clear mechanism of seasonal forcing for modelling is
 a very difficult work because of unidentified formula for seasonal forcing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Altizer2006,Ferrari2010"

\end_inset

.
 For indirectly transmission diseases such as water-born and vector-born,
 finding seasonality characteristics is less a problem, however, in direct
 contrast to transmission diseases such as measles.
 Seasonal forcing in a metapopulation is influenced by weather and climate
 in region, school schedule of children, and rural-urban migration in countries
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1995,Conlan2007,Ferrari2010,Gunning2013"

.
 In these factors, the seasonal aggregation of children in primary schools
 affects clearly the infection rate in metapopulation.
 The infection rate decreases due to children holidays but is inverse when
 the children come back to school

exploring the influence of seasonality for the infection rate in simulation
 has been developed in many previous years.
 If the infection rates given are the same in all subpopulations, so this
 metapopualtion model is a rather simple model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rozhnova2012,Rozhnova12013"

\end_inset

 and the symmetry of the fixed points among subpopulations will not be broken.
 In contrast, if the infection rate is different in all subpopulations,
 so we have a more complex oscilation metapopulation model, but close to
 the oscilations in reality.
 Thus, realizing the oscilations of infectious diseases in life within metapopul
ation simulation models to estimate global disease persistence time has
 become a large problem and the infectious disease eradication has become
 our aim

\begin_layout Standard
Here we propose a simulation study to quantify the effect of synchrony on
 the persistence of infectious diseases.
 We use stochastic simulations for infectious diseases in a metapopualtion,
 then we consider different spatial structures from the simplest to complex.
 These forcings can reflect local demographic, sociological, environmental,
 or climatic factors.
 The level of synchrony is computed from the phases of forcing in the different
 subpopulations and persistence is quantified by using statistical tools
 from survival analysis.
 Here, we are concerned about measles and simultaneously use the parameter
 values from articles and measles reports.
 As the persistence of measles has been largely studied in the literature
 and its still unexplained while global persistence is a growing concern
 for WHO and public health authorities around the world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this, we first build the deterministic model for a metapopualtion.
 Then, we describe the spatial structure and the stochastic version of the
 model.
 Finally, we introduce the characterization of global persistence in the
 metapopulation based on the measles characteristics.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spatial structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A metapopulation is a population of populations (subpopulations).
 Such a structure implies an heterogeneity in the sense where the probability
 of contact (or contact rate) between individuals from a same subpopulation
 is higher than the probability of contact between individuals of different
 subpopulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hanski2004"

\end_inset

.
 Such heterogeneity is actually the result of the interaction between two
 phenomena that are often difficult to disentangle in nature.
 The first one relates to the granularity of the metapopulation (as rendered
 by the number of and sizes of subpopulations) and the second one relates
 to the isolation between subpopulations (as can be rendered, among others,
 by physical distances separating each pair of subpopulations).
 Moreover, according to the findings of Benjamin Bolker (1995) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1995"

\end_inset

, there is no coexistence between periodicity and disease persistence in
 non-spatial measles models, and spatial structure is an important factor
 to both enhance persistence and create new types of dynamic behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify clearly the causes of observed phenomena, these two aspects
 will be modeled distinctly.
 In this article, our null model (model 0) will be a metapopulation without
 any explicit spatial distance (all the subpopulations are at the same distance
 from each other) and where all the metapopulation have the same population
 size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 Like the original Levins's model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

, this model considers that all the subpopulations are at equal distance
 from each other: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij}=\rho,\qquad0\leqslant\rho\leqslant1,\qquad\forall i,\forall j.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The structure of this metapopulation is thus characterized by 3 parameters:
 (i) the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of sub-populations, (ii) the population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}=N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall i$
\end_inset

) of all these subpopulations and, (iii) the coupling (or distance) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

 between two subpopulations 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that refers to the the probability that an individual from subpopulation
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 visits subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
METHOD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Stationary distribution in metapopulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we show some assumptions for the stationary distribution model as follows
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 1.
 For each subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

, there exists a markov chain 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 describing where (i.e.
 in which subpopulation) individuals native from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 travel at each time step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 2.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 has a stationary distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assumption 3.
 At time t=0, each agent is located in a subpopulation randomly drawn from
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when we consider a simplified model in which the dynamics of
 the agents is stationary: each agent native from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 no more follows a markov chain, but is relocated at each time step on a
 subpopulation randomly drawn from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(M_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, under assumptions 1,2,3, at any time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, when the total number of agents grows to infinity, the size of the populations
 under the markovian dynamics converges towards the size of the populations
 under stationary dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, any statistics computed on the densities of agents from the same populatio
n in various cities will not distinguish the markovian from the stationary
 dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on this conclusion, we will deploy a stationary distribution in a
 metapopulation by building a transition matrix and then computing its convergen
ce.
 This matrix converges towards a stationary distribution matrix.
 Finally, we will apply the stationary distribution matrix in the metapopulation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Global persistence in a metapopulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to examine questions of interaction between disease transmissibility
 and phase of seasonal forcing, we start in this section by studing the
 stochastic SEIR model in a metapopualtion of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations.
 For this meta-population, we observe the disease extinction in time due
 to spatial synchrony/asynchrony that are influenced by phase difference
 in seasonal forcing.
 To create the phase difference, we change the value of the forcing phase
 for each subpopulation.
 In this experience, we use a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 in radian that runs in the interval from zero to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 With each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

, based on 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the number of subpopulations in the metapopulation, we divide the interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\varphi_{max}]$
\end_inset

 into a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

 equal samples, so the value of the forcing phase of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 subpopulation is correspondent to 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 value in the set.
 We call 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 asynchrony parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The persistence of disease in the metapopulation was characterized by fitting
 an exponential survival model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 on a data simulated by a stochastic model.
 To measure the persistence in ecology and epidemiology, so many methods
 we can use 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010,Gunning2013,Keeling2002"

\end_inset

.
 For example, Keeling et al.(2002) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keeling2002"

\end_inset

 gave two methods.
 One method was for an isolated metapopulation without migration by calculating
 the expected extinction time or the extinction rate during a given period.
 This was a theoretical measure as no real data exists to compare with model
 results.
 The other method for a population with migration was found by calculating
 the number or the total duration of extinctions.
 Then in 2010, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fade-outs post epidemic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 methods proposed by Conlan 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Conlan2010"

\end_inset

 were used to quantify persistence by basing on the proportion or on the
 frequency of zero reports in a given reporting interval.
 In this work, we propose a new rate that presents also the survival of
 disease in a metapopulation.
 This is the mass extinction rate.
 For our metapopulation of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations, to do so we run first 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 independent simulations of our stochastic model.
 We calculate then the average metapopulation size by summing subpopulations
 at each sample time and averaging across the entire time series for each
 metapopulation.
 Lastly, we record the dates 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of global disease extinction in all these 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 metapopulations.
 These dates allow to draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves from which we estimate
 the global extinction rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M(t)=\exp(-\chi t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant M(t)\leqslant m$
\end_inset

) is the number of metapopulations in which the disease is not extinct at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the parametric survival model for the exponential distribution (R
 package '
\begin_inset Formula $survival$
\end_inset

' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "survival-package"

\end_inset

) to estimate the mass extinction rate of a metapopulation during 100 years.
 Due to that, we can capture one of the most important features of stochastic
 systems in spatial structure : its global extinction characteristics of
 disease.

\begin_layout Subsection
Plan of experience
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will describe our plan of experience to quantifying
 the effect of synchrony on the persistence of infectious diseases in a
 metapopulation.
 We have four big concerns that we must verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quantifying disease persistence in the simplest metapopulation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we are interested in the correlation between global disease persistence
 time and recolonization in metapopulation when the forcing phase of the
 average contact rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 in each subpopulation alters.
 In order to simplify this concern, we start with the metapopulation of
 two subpopulations.
 To have the two subpopulations in synchrony, we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=0$
\end_inset

.
 It means that the forcing phase of 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the same phase, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{1}=\varphi_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The fluctuations of the contact rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(t)_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(t)_{2}$
\end_inset

 are in the same annual sinusoidal form.
 In contrast, to have the two subpopulations in asynchrony, we create the
 phase difference or the phase lag between the subpopulations.
 It means that we have created a metapopulation in heterogeneity.
 Here, we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=\pi$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=\pi$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{2}=\pi$
\end_inset

, then the fluctuations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(t)_{1}$
\end_inset

 is phase lag for 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(t)_{2}$
\end_inset

's.
 Based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

, we are successfully buiding a complex disease metapopulation mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quantifying global extinction and asynchrony level 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will exploit more strongly the role of asynchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 for global disease extinction rate in metapopulation.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 is an important parameter that we use to break fixed points as well as
 first fixed points at begining moments between subpopulations.
 Our goal is to examine the mass extinction for each 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 in the metapopulation.
 Simply, we apply survival regression model over global peristence curve
 at each different 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 value to estimate its global extinction rate.
 We start also with the metapopualtion of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations given and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 It means that we increase level of phase difference from the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We deploy 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 the number of different simulations.
 Then, we use survival analysis to quantify extinction rate at each value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 with confidence interval to 95%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Influence of other parameters on the mass extinction rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiences will turn out how the metapopulation size, the coupling
 strength between subpopulations and the number of subpopulation affect
 the mass extinction rate as well as when the asynchrony parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 varies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Stochastic metapopulation simulations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to run simulations, we use the same values of all parameters for
 all subpopulations.
 We use the Gillespie's direct algorithm

Quantifying disease persistence in the simplest metapopulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start quantifying global disease persistence in the metapopulation of
 two subpopulations by examining degree of synchronization between infected
 individuals in two connected subpopulations.
 This is the simplest metapopulation, for which we can view easily the influence
 of the level of synchrony on the disease persistence and recolonization
 of disease in the metapopulation over time due to the asynchrony parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose here the metapopulation of two subpopulations, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}=N_{2}=300,000$
\end_inset

, the rate of coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.01$
\end_inset

, the number of simulation repeats 
\begin_inset Formula $m=100$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\{0,\pi/2,\pi\}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 metapopulations, we gather the first time where the metapopualtion gets
 global extinction.
 We have three Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each value of

The phase of forcing of the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{1}$
\end_inset

 is always fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, but that of the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{2}$
\end_inset

 increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 In the first experience 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=0$
\end_inset

, the two subpopulations are in synchrony with all beginning conditions.
 In the simulation time, they are easy to find local extinctions together.
 The metapopulation goes globally extinct in a short time.
 The disease persistence time is the shortest.
 Moreover, the two subpopulations become asynchronous when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The symmetry of fixed points is just broken at the starting moment.
 The level of synchrony of the metapopulation decreases.
 The level of asynchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 is directly scaled with the phase difference in the forcing rates, but
 inversly with the global persistence time.
 When 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi$
\end_inset

, 
\series default
the two subpopulations are in antiphase.
 The balance points at the begining moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulaiton_{1}$
\end_inset

 are inverse to that of 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{2}$
\end_inset

, they accounts for why the two subpopulations take a long duration to obtain
 the balance state.
 This is the most difficult case to find global extinction, the persistence
 time is the longest.
 Moreover, theses obtained results are also explicated by the recolonization
 between the two subpopulations.
 When the disease no longer exists in one subpopulation at the moment 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 If at this moment, all neighbouring subpopulations obtain also the extinction,
 so we have a global extinction in the metapopulation and the disease is
 entirely extinct.
 However, in a metapopulation, due to different factors for migration between
 subpopulations, we hardly see extinction at the same time in all subpopulations
 in first duration.
 The infected in other subpopulation migrates to the extinct subpopulation,
 so the disease is active.
 It is the reason why the disease exists for long term.
 In short, the level of synchrony between subpopulation is stronger, metapopualt
ion is easier to find global extinction.
 Make all subpopulations synchronize is the easiest way at which disease
 goes to extinct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, we have exploited experiences on local fluctuations of subpopulati
ons.
 Here, local fluctuations is called local dynamics or local noises.
 This is an important factor that can increase local extinction numbers
 but make global extinction rate reduce as the following figure

\begin_layout Standard
As the result shown in the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figRELA_LocalEXT_nbSUBPOP_phiMAXprobVISIT01"

\end_inset

, the rate of asynchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 robustly affects the relation between the average local extinction number
 and the number of subpopulation in a metapopulation.
 We can find two main results here.
 First, the average local extinction number in any metapopulation has an
 clear increase when the rate of asynchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 augments.
 At the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=0.0$
\end_inset

, it means to set the entire metapopulation in the synchrony state, the
 dynamics of all subpopulations are synchronous and the local extinction
 positions of the subpopulation may be also synchronous.
 Therefore, this average number in the metapopulation is minimum.
 Inversely, when the rate of asynchrony 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 starts tending to increase, the fluctuations are also changed and fallen
 into the difference phase.
 It is the reason why when a subpopulation goes locally extinct and after
 it is redominated in a short time by disease due to the recolonisation
 among subpopulations.
 At the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi$
\end_inset

, the difference phase is maximum.
 The average number of local extinction in a metapopulation is maximum.
 Second, in a metapopulation, if the subpopulation number increases, then
 the local extinction number augments also.
 Because when the subpopulation number is directly scaled with the metapopulatio
n size and the time of disease persistence.
 In addition, the interaction among subpopulation increases with the subpopulati
on number.
 One subpopulation is easy to be dominated by the other subpopulations due
 to the recolonisation.

The result (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) exhibits to us that the number of subpopulations strongly has an influence
 for the disease persistence time.
 The global extinction rate of an infectious disease in a metapopulation
 increases when the number of subpopulations in this metapopulation increases.
 With the metapopulation size is fixed, when the number of cities in the
 metapopulation goes up, it means that the population size of each subpopulation
 is declined.
 In particular, the population size of each subpopulation is very small
 when the number of cities reaches to 30.
 The dynamic in a small population goes fastly extinct.
 Althought, the model used is the coupling metapopulations, there are interactio
ns among subpopulations and recolonisations of desease.
 But because the population size is small, the number of visiteurs going
 to other subpopulation is very little.
 The time of disease persistence in a population having the small size is
 short.
 We fastly find the mass extinction in the metapopulation.

 size augments, at the same time, these rates decreases when the asynchrony

 It is obvious that the metapopualtion size is big, then the time of disease

One more factor that was pointed is coupling strength between subpopulations.
 Here, the coupling rate or the dispersal rate

 can be considered as migration strength.
 The disease transmission speed grows fast when coupling rate goes up in
 metapopulations, but the global extinction rate is inverse (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:resPenteVil05multiRho-1"

\end_inset

).
 In this part, we change coupling rate from weak to strong in a metapopualtion
 of five subpopulations with the metapopulation size 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 .
 The dispersal rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is divided into three intervals.
 These are low, intermediate and high coupling rate intervals.
 In each interval, we chose some coupling rates that highlight the coupling
 strength among subpopulations in a metapopulation.
 When the coupling rate is small from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005$
\end_inset

, the mass extinction rate decreases very slowly.
 Because, in this case, the subpopulations seem to be independent.
 They fluctuate independently.
 They are easy to go extinct.
 We are also easy to find the mass extinction in the metapopulation.
 However, this extinction rate is declined in a sudden way when the coupling
 rate is modified from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3$
\end_inset

.
 Lastly, the extinction rate increases when the coupling rate is so robust
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

.
 Based on this figure, the mass extinction rate in a metapopulation is one
 inverse bell for the coupling rate.
 The medium coupling rate (from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

) minimizes the mass extinction rate in metapopulation.
 As in the case of the small and average coupling rates, the coupling rate
 and the speed of migration among subpopulations are directly proportional.
 The dispersal speed increases, thereby the local recolonization speed rises,
 the duration of persistence grows.
 However, this trend of global extinction rate with decreasing coupling
 rate, is not right any more when the dispersal rate is strong.
 The duration of persistence falls, because the metapopulation has tendency
 to become one big population.
 In this case, the phase difference or the recolonization among subpopulations
 are no longer significant.

We have metapopulation model with different contact rates for each subpopulation.
 This is a more complex model than any used metapopulation model.
 We have sketched successfully in-phase and sometime out-of-phase (

) models across suburbs of He's 2003

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This complex metapopulation model is also an expected result of Rozhnova(2012)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rozhnova2012"

\end_inset

.
 It's a good result for scientists wanting to use the SEIR metapopulation
 model for simulating dynamics of infectious diseases.
 Our results roughly support those of Rozhnova's 2012.
 The authors gave different values of the contact rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 of each subpopulation.
 However, the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 here are fixed by constants and the number of subpopulations in experiences
 are maximum of three.
 Comparing this result with our's, in a coupling metapopulation, the degree
 of synchorny is maintained when the coupling rate between subpopulations
 is weak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, our stochastic SEIR metapopulation model with subpopulations connected
 to each other, we have quantified disease persistence of seasonality as
 well as spatial synchrony.
 With our model, we can easily create level of seasonality in year and at
 the same time, phase difference in seasonality between subpopulations.
 It's the reason why we have model quite close to the metapopulation model
 in reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the phase difference between the number of contact 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, we can change by an increase or a decrease in level of synchrony.
 We want to decrease level of synchrony, by simply increasing the phase
 difference between forcing phase coefficients in the formulas of the number
 of contact 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the level of synchrony between two subpopulations are the worst
 when the two fluctuations are in antiphase (as figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:persm100phi0pi2pi_01"

\end_inset

).
 When the phase difference between oscillations increases, the desynchronizing
 effect on population dynamics of the subpopulations augments.
 This enhances disease persistence time though the global extinction rate
 is reduced.
 Moreover, as the result above (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:perrateVil15Rho01n1e6"

\end_inset

), in the local shape,
\series bold
 
\series default
our result, along with those of Bolker (1995) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1995"

\end_inset

 and Heino (1997) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heino1997"

\end_inset

, stress the number of local extinctions
\series bold
 
\series default
being inversely proportionnel with the global extinction rate in a metapopulatio
n.
 When the level of synchrony is at a reduction and the global persistence
 time gets an increase, the global extinction rate of metapopulation goes
 down and the number of local extinction goes up.
 Due to the result about local extinction, we also affirm that disease is
 always available in metapopulation if and only if at least one subpopulaiton
 is not extinct.

\begin_layout Standard
Our finding has specified the two main factors influencing the persistence
 ability of an infectious disease.
 One factor is transmission characteristics of the infectious disease and
 the other is interplay between mixing subpopulations in metapopulation.
 The interaction between the disease persistence and the spatial heterogeneity
 becomes a major key to unlock questions about infectious disease in epidemiolog
y.
 This result takes a large part in epidemic disease persistence domain that
 has being exploited in scientific epidemically research works.
 We gained a robust understanding of how disease persistence is affected
 by local factors such as spatial heterogeneity, demographic asynchrony
 and seasonality, as well as mixing factors such as migration, disease transmiss
ion between hosts and pathogens.
 Lastly, we also highlighted recolonization effects.
 It is like rescue for disease.
 Because of connection between subpopulation, individuals can go everywhere.
 Subpopulation is quickly re-infected althought the disease has became extinct.
 Thus, the disease rescus makes local extintions difficult to extend into
 global extinctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a matter of the fact of coupling strength among subpopulations in metapopulat
ion, we proved that the curve of the global extinction rate is a convex
 function following the coupling rate.
 Inversely, the persistence of the disease in the metapopulation is an exponenti
al survival function over time and is a humped function for the coupling
 rate.
 In addition, when the coupling rate between subpopulations is just medium
 where the mass extinction rate is minimum and the global disease persistence
 in metapopulation is maximum .
 This finding is similar to those of Huffaker(1958)

, Holyoak and Lawler(1996)

 (2012) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 when they exhaustively explored the disease persistence behavior of many
 different metapopulation models.
 And our result one more time affirms that the interaction in metapopulation
 models plays a big role when
\series bold
 
\series default
the interaction strength 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is from 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, we have built successfully a
\series bold
 
\series default
sinusoidally forced SEIR stochastic metapopulation model.
 This model is like a physical system of coupled oscillators.
 We have pointed out that spatial synchronization consistently and predictably
 makes extinction risk increase by using the model 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 where all the subpopulations have the same population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and there is no explicit spatial distance.
 So, it's good for the future, we can continue this work with different
 population size of each subpopulation and different spatial distance between
 subpopulations and then, create synchronous metapopulations that optimize
 vaccination policies.

We start with ordinary differential equations for a 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 in a metapopulation as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\\
\frac{dE_{i}}{dt} & = & \lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu E_{i}-\sigma E_{i}\\
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} & = & \sigma E_{i}-\mu I_{i}-\gamma I_{i}\\
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 In simulation, we know that the equilibrium state allow a disease to persist
 in a population for a long time.
 So, an infectious disease in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 is available in long term this system is at equilibrium.
 It means that at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dS_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dI{}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dR{}_{i}}{dt}=0$
\end_inset

 (*).
 Thus, we let all equations (equations 
\begin_inset Formula $15$
\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Formula $18$
\end_inset

 ) in the system be equal to zero, then calculate the values of the variables
 (now denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 , and 
\begin_inset Formula $R{}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

) that satisfy this condition (*).
 We have these values as folllows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}{\beta\sigma}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma+\mu}-\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta\sigma}\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\frac{\beta\sigma-(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}{\beta(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, if we set 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}=\frac{\beta\sigma}{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}$
\end_inset

, so we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
One nomal conditions for all population availabes is that the equilibrium
 values cannot be negative.
 Therefore, an infectious disease is available in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$

 if

 Now, the endemic equilibrium in the system is given by

The figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "figRELLocalEXTSubPOP_METASIZE_phiMAX"

\end_inset

 shows the relation between the average local extinction number and the
 number of subpopulation in a metapopulation.
 We find that the local extinction number is minimum when the metapopulation
 size is maximum.
 Because with a big metapopulation, the size of a subpopulation is great.
 It is the reason why this subpopulation is very difficile to find the local
 extinction.
 Inversely, when the metapopulation size is small, then the persistence
 time is short.
 Thus, this metapopulation goes to the global extinction in the easy way.
 On the other hand, we can find that the metapopulation size in the interval
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $5e+05$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1e+06$
\end_inset

, the local extinction number is high.
 It means that the size of a subpopulation is approximately from 
\begin_inset Formula $1e+05$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $5e+05$
\end_inset

.
 This is the interval that permit a disease to spread and permit the time
 of disease persistence to be enough long to study.
 Finally, we get also the same result, the local extinction number are in
 increase with the number of subpopulation in a metapopulation.

, the local extinction number is minimum when the coupling rate is equal
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0$
\end_inset

.
 It is obvious that in a metapopulation where the subpopulations are isolated,
 there is no recolonisation among subpopulation.
 After the local extinction number strongly increases when the coupling
 rate augments.
 However, this number is biggest when the coupling rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 Because at this rate where the subpopulations are in the mediate interaction.
 Moreover the coupling rate and the speed of migration among subpopulations
 are directly proportional.
 The dispersal speed increases, thereby the local recolonization speed rises,
 the duration of persistence grows.
 However, when the dispersal rate is more big, this trend of local extinction
 number decreases.
 Because the metapopulation has tendency to become one big population, so
 the phase difference or the recolonization among subpopulations are no
 longer significant.
 The following figure
