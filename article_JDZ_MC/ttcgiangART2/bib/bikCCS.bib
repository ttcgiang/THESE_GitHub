  abstract = {Measles epidemics in human populations exhibit what is perhaps the
	best empirically characterized, and certainly the most studied, stochastic
	persistence threshold in population biology. A critical community
	size (CCS) of around 250,000-500,000 separates populations where
	measles is predominantly persistent from smaller communities where
	there are frequent extinctions of measles between major epidemics.
	The fundamental mechanisms contributing to this pattern of persistence,
	which are long-lasting immunity to re-infection, recruitment of susceptibles,
	seasonality in transmission, age dependence of transmission and the
	spatial coupling between communities, have all been quantified and,
	to a greater or lesser level of success, captured by theoretical
	models. Despite these successes there has not been a consensus over
	whether simple models can successfully predict the value of the CCS,
	or indeed which mechanisms determine the persistence of measles over
	a broader range of population sizes. Specifically, the level of the
	CCS has been thought to be particularly sensitive to the detailed
	stochastic dynamics generated by the waiting time distribution (WTD)
	in the infectious and latent periods. We show that the relative patterns
	of persistence between models with different WTDs are highly sensitive
	to the criterion of comparison-in particular, the statistical measure
	of persistence that is employed. To this end, we introduce two new
	statistical measures of persistence-fade-outs post epidemic and fade-outs
	post invasion. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that,
	no matter the choice of persistence measure, appropriately parametrized
	models of measles demonstrate similar predictions for the level of
	the CCS.},

  abstract = {Persistence and extinction are fundamental processes in ecological
	systems that are difficult to accurately measure due to stochasticity
	and incomplete observation. Moreover, these processes operate on
	multiple scales, from individual populations to metapopulations.
	Here, we examine an extensive new data set of measles case reports
	and associated demographics in pre-vaccine era US cities, alongside
	a classic England & Wales data set. We first infer the per-population
	quasi-continuous distribution of log incidence. We then use stochastic,
	spatially implicit metapopulation models to explore the frequency
	of rescue events and apparent extinctions. We show that, unlike critical
	community size, the inferred distributions account for observational
	processes, allowing direct comparisons between metapopulations. The
	inferred distributions scale with population size. We use these scalings
	to estimate extinction boundary probabilities. We compare these predictions
	with measurements in individual populations and random aggregates
	of populations, highlighting the importance of medium-sized populations
	in metapopulation persistence.},
