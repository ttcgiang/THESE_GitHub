 In general, vaccination protects not only those who are vaccinated but

 As a result, many others in the community can also be benefited.
 However, whether or not to vaccinate largely depends on the perceived risk
 of infection and the vaccination behavior of neighboring individuals

 viewed vaccine allocation as a nonlinear optimization problem in which
 the objective was to minimize the total number of infections across a populatio
n.
 The authors proposed two vaccination policies : a portion of the total
 vaccine supply was designated to be distributed pro-rata, which is equitable
 distribution by population, and the other portion of the vaccine supply
 was to be discretionarily distributed.
 The result : the purely equitable distribution was the least efficient
 allocation in terms of minimizing the total number of infections in the
 population.
 The purely discretionary policy is efficient, but highly inequitable.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
they used a mathematical model to find the optimal vaccine allocation at
 different time points of an epidemic.
 For both developed and less developed countries, when faced with low supplies
 of vaccines, it is always optimal to concentrate vaccine in high-risk children
 to provide them with direct protection, as they are part of the high-transmissi
on chain and they are among the most vulnerable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pointed out that : Choosing the optimal strategy before or early in the
 epidemic makes an important difference in minimizing the number of influenza
 infections, and consequently the number of influenza deaths or hospitalizations
, but the optimal strategy makes little difference after the peak.
 When averting deaths, it is better to allocate vaccine in the high-risk
 groups first and then cover high- transmission groups.
 Once vaccine supplies reach a certain coverage level, then it becomes important
 to vaccinate the high- transmission groups in the earlier stages of the
 epidemic, but this policy becomes suboptimal once the peak of the epidemic
 has passed.
 This is because by allocating this much vaccine in children earlier on
 in the epidemic, we would be able to block transmission and mitigate the
 disease, but if vaccination took place later on in the epidemic, there
 are too many people already infected and this strategy is no longer optimal.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Limitation :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A limitation of the network models presented above is that they are all
 specific to disease propagation.
 However, network models applied to more general contexts also provide insight
 into the vaccine allocation problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The limitation of these framework is that many attributes described in the
 research depend upon a well- defined notion of community structure.
 However, it is exceedingly difficult to detect and distinguish communities
 within a larger network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In fact, the big differences between perceived risk of infectious disease
 and actual risk of infectious disease.
 Therefore, individuals likely make great errors when making their choices
 for vaccination.
 Thus, these errors must be taken into account when considering policy actions
 to be taken to move toward a socially optimal allocation

 in an optimal fashion.
 By mathematical analysis of this model, they determined the feasibility
 of a vaccination policy by using the Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), they
 searched for vaccination policies that minimize the number of infected
 people.
 They compared these policies to plausible benchmark policies to verify
 that the EA policies are more effective.

Analysis of the EA policies indicates that the vaccine is generally distributed

Reason: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Evolutionary programs are capable of finding good solutions to difficult
 optimization problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Previous analysis of their convergence properties has normally assumed the
 strategy parameters are kept constant, although in practice these parameters
 are dynamically altered.
 - In this paper, we propose a modified version of the 1/5-success rule
 for self-adaptation in evolution strategies (ES).
 Evolutionary programs are probabilistic algorithms that use the principles
 of population genetics to search for problem solutions.
 They are capable of finding good solutions to a wide variety of optimization
 problems, including NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (Back,
 1996).

 : These 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 parents (candidate solutions) produce 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 offspring (new solutions) by mutating one or more problem parameters.
 Parents and offspring compete equally for survival; only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 best (i.e., those with the highest fitness) will survive to reproduce in
 the next generation.
 Done properly, the population will evolve towards increasingly better regions
 of the search space by means of reproduction and survival of the ttest.

 Thus individuals live for only a single generation regardless of their
 tness level.
 This approach may result in short periods of recession, but it does avoid
 long periods of stagnation.

Reinforcement learning in vacination policies - proposed by JEAN Daniel
 Zucker (very complex)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reinforcement learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, is the study
 of algorithms that learn how to choose the best actions depending on the
 situation.
 In a reinforcement learning problem the algorithm is not told which actions
 give the best results, but instead it has to interact with the environment
 to learn when and where to take a certain action.
 When the agent has learned about each situation or state of the environment,
 it will arrive at an optimal sequence of actions (Barto and Sutton 1998).
 Instead of finding the best results, we find an optimal result for the
 state of the evironnement at time t.
