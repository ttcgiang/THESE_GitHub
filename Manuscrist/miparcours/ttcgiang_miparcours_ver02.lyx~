This thesis is taking place in a context where many public health serious
 events have occurred in the world : SRAS in 2003, avian influenza in 2004
 or swine flu in 2009.

In particular, in the start of the 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO)
 had officially to state global measles epidemic outbreak.
 In the first three months of the year 2014, there were about 56,000 cases
 of measle infections in 75 countries

This has pointed out the important role of the epidemiological phenomena
 anticipation when diseases occur.
 Moreover, for vaccination policies, the mass policy (vaccinate the maximum
 number of children before certain age) is the oldest (started from the
 1950s in the rich countries) and is now the most used.
 The problem of this vaccination policy is too expensive, ineffective and
 quite impossible to implement in poor countries, especially in Africa as
 both financial and logistical problems.
 (e.g.
 the WHO project 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Extended Programm on Immunization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Vietnam for the measles extinction before 2012 is failed).
 In addition, when a vaccination policy is performed in a country, there
 is only one policy, but in modelation, we can realize many policies and
 at the same time estimate them.
 Therefore, optimize the vaccination policies in Artificial Intelligence
 in order that these policies may become more effective, less expensive,
 and take into account the spatial dimension, is the goal of this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To carry out this goal, the first task is to make a state of the art covering
 the different epidemic models being used in the field of epidemiological
 modeling.
 In the second step, we will focus on design or expanse for representation
 language that allows modelers to express the goals of model simulations
 as well as constraints related to them.
 In the third step, we will concetrate on stochastic models, and investigate
 disease spread caracteristics between population and community in a spatial
 context.
 We then study local/global disease persistence, disease periodicity and
 the influence of space on the disease persistence.
 Finally, we will perform vaccination policies in a metapopulation and optimize
 them bu using reinforcement learning algorithms

Epidemic model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that, there are many current models that are used to model complex
 systems in nature, in ecology system and in epidemiology.
 Mathematical models in epidemiology are a typical exemple.
 These models permit us to present behavior of diseases and disease process
 in mathematics.
 They have given us good results in mathematics as deterministic models
 in which every set of variable states is only determined by parameters
 in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables.
 In detail, the deterministic models are equations, for that they perform
 the same way for a given set of initial conditions.
 But they don't have randomness, dynamics, and don't present dynamic of
 diseases in nature.
 Thus, stochastic models have been proposed.
 A sotchastic model is always more realistic than a deterministic one.
 These models have stochastic and variable states are not described by unique
 values, but by probability distributions.
 It is reason for that, we will use the stochastic models to predict extinction
 propability of disease in spatial context

\begin_layout Standard
To present the process of infection propagation in community, we give here
 the development of epidemic models by focusing on acute infections, assuming
 the pathogen causes illness for a periods of time followed by (typically
 lifelong) immunity.
 The first simplest model is the S-I-R model created by W.
 O.
 Kermack and A.
 G.
 McKendrick in 1927.
 The authors categorized hosts within a population as Susceptible (if not
 yet exposed to the pathogen), Infected (if currenly infected by the pathogen)
 and Recovered (if they have successfully cleared the infection).
 From the simplest SIR model, in order to accord each infectious disease
 and real property of disease, scientists have modified it, made it different
 multiforme.
 However, in shape of this thesis, we concentrate on the SEIR model (as
 the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) that fit many currently infectious diseases in the world.
 Each patient must pass four steps : susceptible stage, incubation stage,
 infectious stage and recovered stage.

In this model, the host population (N) is divided into four classes : susceptibl
e S(t), exposed E(t), infected I(t) and recovered R(t).
 We have :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)=S(t)+E(t)+I(t)+R(t)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classe S(t) : contains the number of individuals not yet with the disease
 at time t, or those susceptible to the disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classe E(t) : contains the number of individuals who are in the exposed
 or latent period of the disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classe I(t) : contains the number of individuals who have been infected
 with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the
 susceptible category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classe R(t) : contains the number of individuals who have been infected
 and then removed from the disease, either due to immunization or due to
 death.
 Individuals of this classe are not able to be infected again or to transmit
 the disease infection to others.

The conceptual descriptions of the model can be represented by a flow diagram
 above.
 The flow diagram for the SEIR model uses arrows to present the movement
 between the S and I classes, the E and I classes and the I and R classses.
 Here, individuals are born susceptible, die at a rate

\begin_layout Subsection
Process stochasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the process stochasticity, we talk about demographic and environmental
 stochasticities in epidemic models.
 The demographic stochasticity is strongly controlled by population size
 such as the birth and death rates, contamination,etc.
 But, the environmental stochasticity is just affected by environmental
 factors what we can not govern.
 Therefore, there are many epidemic models that forcus on exploration of
 demographic stochasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demographic stochasticity is considered as fluctuation in population processes
 that are based the random nature of events at the level of the individual.
 Each event is related to one baseline probability fixed, individuals are
 presented in differing fates due to chance.
 In addition to the demographic stochasticity, the number of infectious,
 susceptible, exposed and recovered individuals is now required to be an
 interger.
 Modeling approches that incorporate demographic stochasticity are called
 event-driven methods.
 These methods require explicit consideration of events.
 The first method
\series bold
 
\series default
"First Reaction Method” is born in 1976 by Gillespie.
 Then, according to this first method and these two key factors of demographic
 stochasticity models (event, randomness) , many scientists have improved
 the first method, and created many better algorithms for stochastic simulations.
 There are two main types of methods, exact methods and approximative methods.
 The typical approche in exact methods most practitioners use, is the algorithm
 “Direct Method” of Gillespie(1977) improved from the first approche “First
 Reaction Method”, and in approximative methods, is the “tau-leaping” method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Direct Method (Gillespie 1977), the first step estimates the time
 until the next event, by cumulating the rates of all possible events.
 Then, by transforming event rates into propabilities, the method randomly
 selects one of these events.
 The time and numbers in each class are then updated according to which
 event is chosen.
 We repeate this process to iterate model through time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tau-leaping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method, the main crux is the use of Poisson random variables to approximate
 the number of occurrences of each type of reaction event during a carefully
 selected time period, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset


\series bold
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to these two types of algorithms, the common point is both methods
 use continuous-time Markov process for which the transition rates are constants
, isn't a function of time.
 The future state of the process, is only conditional on the present state,
 but independent of the past.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, for the exact algorithm, its advantage give us a really exact approach
 to simulate time-to-event model.
 This process is repeated to iterate the model.
 Gibson & Bruck(2000) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KeelingRohani2008"

\end_inset

 modified the first reaction method and created the Next Reaction method
 that substantially more challenging to program but is significantly faster
 than even the method when there are a large number of different event types.
 The Direct, First Reaction and Next Reaction methods are all exact stochastic
 approaches of the underlying ordinary differential equations.
 But, its disavantages are 1) noise in exact simulations only affects the
 probabilities associated with fates of individuals and the updating of
 each consecutive event is independent – there is no assumption concerning
 environmental stochasticity; 2) these exact solutions become too slow and
 impractical when any one transition rate is large, when there is a big
 number of subpopulations or one a big number of event in a metapopulation.
 It is the reason for that, approximate models have been proposed instead
 of the exact stochastic methods.
 Gillespie (2001) has proposed a new method that decreases the simulation
 accuracy, but increases simulation speed.
 This is the “tau-leap method” known as an approximate method reduces the
 number of iterations by treating transition rates as constant over time
 periods for which this approximation leads to little error

 as mentioned above.
 However, when we use the “tau-leap method”, there is a possibility, the
 number of indivudal in each class can become negative.

 Because the direct method is one exact approach and its simulation time

Equilibrium values of the system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a case the infectious contact rate is constant, the equilibrium values
 of the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 can be expressed analytically as follows.
 We know that, in simulation, the equilibrium state allow a disease to persist
 in a population for a long time.
 So, an infectious disease in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 is available in long term this system is at equilibrium.
 It means that at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dS_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dI{}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dR{}_{i}}{dt}=0$
\end_inset

 (*).
 Thus, we let all equations (equations 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 ) in the system be equal to zero, then calculate the values of the variables
 (now denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 , and 
\begin_inset Formula $R{}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

) that satisfy this condition (*).
 We have these values as folllows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}{\beta\sigma}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma+\mu}-\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta\sigma}\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\frac{\beta\sigma-(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}{\beta(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, if we set 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}=\frac{\beta\sigma}{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}$
\end_inset

, so we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One nomal conditions for all population availabes is that the equilibrium
 values cannot be negative.
 Therefore, an infectious disease is available in the

\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}>1$

 Now, the endemic equilibrium in the system is given by

Random numbers have a big role in apllications such as simulation, game-playing,
 statistical sampling, transport calculations and computations in satistical
 physics.
 Depending on each appication, it has its own generator with its own set
 of advantages and disadvantages.
 In the shape of my thesis, we use the pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs)
 in the programming language C++.
 This is an algorithm that can automatically create long runs of numbers
 with good random properties.
 The sequence of values generated by the algorithms is generally determined
 by a fixed number called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, there is a problem is if the number of time that call generator
 is too large, so the sequence of values repeats or the memory usage grows
 without bound.
 In addtion to the set of the random number generators, here we mention
 also a method that generates random variables with a normal distribution
 (i.e.
 Gaussian) of C.
 Paciorek in 2001.
 This method allows us to generate a standard normally-distributed random
 variable (scalar) due to the Gaussian distribution.
 We will use both generators to do simulations.

Here, in order to do simulation, in first steps of my thesis, we focus on
 the exploration of the influence of the phase difference among subpopulations,
 the population size, number of subpopulation in a metapopulation, couplage
 strength between two subpopulations on the persistence of infectious diseases
 in spatial structure.
 The number of subpopulation in a metapopulation is in the interval from
 2 to 30.
 The population size of each subpopulation is from 5000 individuals to 500000
 individuals.
 Finally, the couplage strength is from 0.0001 to 1.0.
 In the next part, we will show results obtained.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We built successfully a package named “dizzys''.
 This package in R implements both the exact and approximate methods for
 the deterministic/stochastic SEIR/SIR models by integrating the R package
 and the C++ implementation.
 We use C++ to perform the algorithms, and use R to create interfaces.
 Hence, this new integration is faster than any pure R implementation.
 The figures below are results of the simulations of deterministic and stochasti
c SEIR models.

Global persistence in a metapopulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we start exploiting the package "dizzys
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In order to illustrate the interaction between disease transmissibility
 and phase difference among subpopulations.
 We start this section by studing the stochastic SEIR model in a metapopulation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations.
 For this meta-population, we observe the disease extinction in time due
 to spatial synchrony or spatial asynchrony that are influenced by phase
 difference in seasonal forcing parameter.
 To create phase difference, we change the value of the forcing phase for
 each city.
 In this experience, we use a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 in radian that runs in the interval from zero to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 With each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

, based on 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset


\series default
 the number of subpopulations in the metapopulation, we divide the interval
 [0, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

] into a set of (n-1) equal samples, so the value of the forcing phase of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 city is correspondent to 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 value in the set.
 We call 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 asynchrony parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our metapopulation of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 subpopulations, to do so we run first 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 independent simulations of our stochastic model.
 We calculate then the average metapopulation size by summing subpopulations
 at each sample time and averaging across the entire time series for each
 metapopulation.
 Lastly, we record the dates 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of global disease extinction in all these 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 metapopulations.
 These dates allowed to draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves from which we
 estimated the extinction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M(t)=\exp(-\chi t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant M(t)\leqslant m$
\end_inset

) is the number of metapopulations in which the disease is not extinct at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The extinction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 is reparameterized in terms of predictor variables and regression parameters.
 Here, we reparameterize
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi=exp(-p)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is a parameter that characterizes the probability of the global disease
 persistence and is estimated by the survival regression model (R package
 '
\begin_inset Formula $survival$
\end_inset

' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "survival-package"

\end_inset

).
 For that, we find the extinction rate where the number of metapopulations
 in which the disease is extinct in time.
 Then, we will study the relation between the global persistence and its
 level of synchrony due to the phase of the forcing.

The phase of forcing of the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{1}$
\end_inset

 is always fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, but this of the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{2}$
\end_inset

 increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 It means that, in the first experience, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=0$
\end_inset

, the two subpopulations are in synchrony with all beginning conditions.
 The disease persistence time is the shortest.
 Then, the two subpopulations become asynchrony when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The symmetry of fixed points is just broken at the starting moment.
 It is reason for that the level of synchrony of the metapopulation decreases.
 Additionally, we find that the value of the asynchrony parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 change according to increasing tendency, the phase difference between the
 fluctuations of the two infection rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 increases also, and the global persistence time in the metapopulation thus
 augments.
 When 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi$
\end_inset

, 
\series default
the two subpopulations are in antiphase.
 This is the most difficult case to find global extinction, the persistence
 time is the longest.
 In short, the level of synchrony between subpopulation is stronger, metapopulat
ion is easier to find global extinction.
 Make all subpopulations synchronize is the easiest way at which disease
 goes to extinct.

In this part, each Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the global disease persistence
 time in a metapopulation for each value 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$

 is parametrized as rate by the survival regression model.
 Depending on the base of the persistence time caused by the phase difference
 in the metapopulation of two subpopulations, we are going to exploit metapopula
tions of many subpopulations.
 We use the parametric survival model to estimate this global persistence
 with confidence interval 95%.

The global extintion rates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 are in an inverse of the global persistence.
 We see that the extinction rate reduces when the degree of asynchrony augments.
 So in order to destroy infectious diseases, we need to make subpopulations
 be in synchrony over long time.
 The asynchrony between subpopulations is the main reason to respond very
 familiar question why has the infectious disease been never extinct.

Population size of subpopulation

In the metapopulation of 06 subpopulations, we implement experiences with
 different population sizes of subpopulation.
 We performe 100 different simulation for the metapopulation of 06 subpopulation
s in which all subpopulation has the same population size N.
 We set N from 5000 to 500000 individuals.
 The result (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) affirms that the population size influences strongly the global persistence
 time of an infectious disease in a metapopulation.
 The number of individuals in a subpopulation increases, so the global persisten
ce of disease increases also.

In addition to the result of the population size, here we are going to explore
 influence of the number of subpopulation in a metapopulation on disease
 persistence of this metapopulation.
 We set first all metapopulation is the same population size 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10^{5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}=\pi$
\end_inset

 and the coupling rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.001$
\end_inset

 then we change the number of subpopulation in metapopulation from three
 to 30.
 We obtain the same result as when the population size augments.
 The persistence probability scales directly the number of subpopulation
 in a metapopulation.

\begin_layout Standard
According to Keeling(2008), due to dispersal rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, the persistence time of metapopulation is considered as a function of
 dispersal rate.
 In order to affirm this supposition, here we change coupling rate from
 weak to strong in a metapopulation of five subpopulations with the population
 size of each subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 The dispersal rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is divided into three intervals.
 These are low, intermediate and high coupling rate intervals.
 In each interval, we choose some coupling rates that highlight the coupling
 strength among subpopulations in metapopulation.
 We have the result as follows (figure

When the coupling rate is small from 0.0001 to 0.003, the gradient of the
 correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{max}$
\end_inset

 and the global persistence increases very slowly.
 However, the persistence probability augments in a sudden way when the
 coupling rate changes from 0.005 to 0.1.
 Lastly, the gradient strongly decreases when the coupling rate is so robust
 from 0.3 to 1.0.
 Based on this figure, the global disease persistence in a metapopulation
 is one humped function for the coupling rate.
 The medium coupling rate (from 0.005 to 0.1) maximizes disease persistence
 in metapopulation.

Conclusion and perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We successfully built a version for the susceptible-infected-recovered stochasti
c metapopulation model.
 The infection rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 portrayed all effects inside as well as outside on disease transmission
 chain between individuals in the same subpopulation or among subpopulations.
 Moreover, our metapopulation model became more detailed when we brought
 seasonality in metapopulation model to create periodic transmission in
 year that here highlights seasonal change as well as school period of children.
 We have metapopulation model with different contact rates.
 This is more complex model than any used metapopulation model.
 We sketched successfully in-phase and sometime out-of-phase (“antiphase'')
 models across suburbs of He's 2003

In order to continue my thesis, we will exploit the global persistence and
 the disease transmission among subpopulations under a new shape of metapopulati
on in epidemiology.
 It is the gravity model in epidemiology.
 This model is a very simple model, and can be used to explain the spatial
 epidemiologic dynamics.
 We says it simply that the strength of coupling between any two populations
 depends on the size of these two populations and the distance between them
 (so this model is quite similar to Newton's law of universal gravitation,
 the attraction between two bodies depends on the masses of the bodies and
 the distance between the bodies).
 In epidemiology, we will call the “mass” the population size.
 Then, we set a gravity metapopulation model with the different positions
 and the different population sizes of subpopulations.
 Finally, we will exploit the disease transmission in the gravity metapopulation
 model.

One more main work in my thesis, it is the optimization of the vaccination
 policies.
 We set it in the last part of my thesis, because first of all, we must
 deeply exploit the actual nature of the infectious disease transmission
 in the different disease model, then we are going to have a good vaccination
 policy for a metapopulation.
