  abstract = {Measles epidemics in human populations exhibit what is perhaps the
	best empirically characterized, and certainly the most studied, stochastic
	persistence threshold in population biology. A critical community
	size (CCS) of around 250,000-500,000 separates populations where
	measles is predominantly persistent from smaller communities where
	there are frequent extinctions of measles between major epidemics.
	The fundamental mechanisms contributing to this pattern of persistence,
	which are long-lasting immunity to re-infection, recruitment of susceptibles,
	seasonality in transmission, age dependence of transmission and the
	spatial coupling between communities, have all been quantified and,
	to a greater or lesser level of success, captured by theoretical
	models. Despite these successes there has not been a consensus over
	whether simple models can successfully predict the value of the CCS,
	or indeed which mechanisms determine the persistence of measles over
	a broader range of population sizes. Specifically, the level of the
	CCS has been thought to be particularly sensitive to the detailed
	stochastic dynamics generated by the waiting time distribution (WTD)
	in the infectious and latent periods. We show that the relative patterns
	of persistence between models with different WTDs are highly sensitive
	to the criterion of comparison-in particular, the statistical measure
	of persistence that is employed. To this end, we introduce two new
	statistical measures of persistence-fade-outs post epidemic and fade-outs
	post invasion. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that,
	no matter the choice of persistence measure, appropriately parametrized
	models of measles demonstrate similar predictions for the level of
	the CCS.},

	multiple scales, from individual populations to metapopulations.
	Here, we examine an extensive new data set of measles case reports
	and associated demographics in pre-vaccine era US cities, alongside
	a classic England & Wales data set. We first infer the per-population
	quasi-continuous distribution of log incidence. We then use stochastic,
	spatially implicit metapopulation models to explore the frequency
	of rescue events and apparent extinctions. We show that, unlike critical
	community size, the inferred distributions account for observational
	processes, allowing direct comparisons between metapopulations. The
	inferred distributions scale with population size. We use these scalings
	to estimate extinction boundary probabilities. We compare these predictions
	with measurements in individual populations and random aggregates
	of populations, highlighting the importance of medium-sized populations
	in metapopulation persistence.},

  abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability
	are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics.
	Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of
	the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this
	paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems
	to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms
	and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence
	points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality
	can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes
	in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters
	with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births
	and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models
	and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality
	can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and
	that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles
	to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective,
	understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important
	insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite
	control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond
	to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality.
	Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases,
	we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other
	ecological interactions.},

	management and conservation purposes. Spatial dynamics can have a
	crucial role in population stability via synchronization, and beneficial
	and detrimental effects on population persistence have been shown.
	Despite a theoretical understanding of synchronization, empirical
	data on synchrony of populations are restricted to systems that do
	not display the full spectrum of complex dynamics that may occur
	in nature (that is, chaos or quasiperiodicity). Here we show in experiments
	that the qualitative form of dynamic behaviour of chaotic and periodic
	oscillating communities did not change when unidirectionally coupled
	to oscillating driver communities. Driver and response populations
	were phase locked in cyclic communities, whereas chaotic communities
	showed only short periods of statistical coherencies. Our study provides
	the first empirical analysis of synchronization of chaotic communities
	and shows that the likelihood for chaos is not lowered in spatially
	explicit systems but that cyclic and chaotic systems differ in synchronization.},

	of the recent re-emergence of pertussis in the United States to compare
	its spatial transmission dynamics throughout the 1950s with the past
	decade. We report 4-year waves, sweeping across the continent in
	the 1950s. These waves are shown to emanate from highly synchronous
	foci in the northwest and northeast coasts. In contrast, the recent
	resurgence of the disease is characterized by 5.5-year epidemics
	with no particular spatial structure. We interpret this to be the
	result of dramatic changes in patterns of human movement over the
	second half of the last century, together with changing age distribution
	of pertussis. We conclude that extrapolation regarding the spatial

	we report on an experiment where we manipulated migration rate within
	metapopulations of the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna to examine
	how migration influenced each of these demographic variables, and
	subsequent effects on metapopulation extinction. In addition, our
	experimental procedures introduced unplanned but controlled differences
	between metapopulations in light intensity, enabling us to examine
	the relative influences of environmental and demographic factors.
	We found that increasing migration rate increased subpopulation synchrony.
	We failed to detect effects of migration on population size and fluctuations
	in population size at the metapopulation or subpopulation level,
	however. In contrast, light intensity did not influence synchrony,
	but was positively correlated with population size and negatively
	correlated with population fluctuation. Finally, synchrony did not
	influence time to extinction, while population size and the magnitude
	of fluctuations did. We conclude that environmental factors had a
	greater influence on extinction risk than demographic factors, and
	that metapopulation size and fluctuation were more important to extinction

	focusing on the dynamics of house finch conjunctivitis (Mycoplasma
	gallisepticum (MG) in Carpodacus mexicanus). This case study of an
	unmanaged emerging infectious disease provides useful insight into
	the important role of seasonal factors in driving ongoing disease
	dynamics. Seasonal breeding can force recurrent epidemics through
	the input of fresh susceptibles, which will clearly affect a wide
	variety of wildlife disease dynamics. Seasonal patterns of social
	aggregation and foraging behaviour could change transmission dynamics.
	We use latitudinal variation in the timing of breeding, and social
	systems to model seasonal dynamics of house finch conjunctivitis
	across eastern North America. We quantify the patterns of seasonal
	breeding, and social aggregation across a latitudinal gradient in
	the eastern range of the house finch, supplemented with known field
	and laboratory information on immunity to MG in finches. We then
	examine the interactions of these factors in a theoretical model
	of disease dynamics. We find that both forms of seasonality could
	explain the dynamics of the house finch-MG system, and that these
	factors could have important effects on the dynamics of wildlife
	diseases generally. In particular, while either alone is sufficient
	to create recurrent cycles of prevalence in a population with an
	endemic disease, both are required to produce the specific semi-annual
	pattern of disease prevalence seen in the house finch conjunctivitis
	system.},

  abstract = {Most mathematical models used to study the epidemiology of childhood
	viral diseases, such as measles, describe the period of infectiousness
	by an exponential distribution. The effects of including more realistic
	descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered)
	models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have
	two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour
	is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex.
	Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite
	population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence
	increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution
	is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models
	in population biology. Since it has a major effect on the central
	issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this
	study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide
	range of biological systems.},

	of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic
	understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission
	dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV),
	in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying
	foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high
	case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized
	from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory
	mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence;
	including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed
	changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation
	of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number
	of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations,
	and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory
	behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving
	rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction.
	Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary
	flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate
	that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the
	peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over
	hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic
	framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV
	emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks
	in horses and people.},

	around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple
	epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures
	the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility;

	demonstrates that long-term persistence is maximized when the rate
	at which individuals disperse among patches within the system is
	intermediate; if too low, local extinctions are more frequent than
	recolonizations, increasing the chance of regional-scale extinctions,
	and if too high, dynamics exhibit region-wide synchrony, and local
	extinctions occur in near unison across the region. Although common,
	little is known about how the size and topology of the metapopulation
	(metacommunity) affect this bell-shaped relationship between dispersal
	rate and regional persistence time. Using a suite of mathematical
	models, we examined the effects of dispersal, patch number, and topology
	on the regional persistence time when local populations are subject
	to demographic stochasticity. We found that the form of the relationship
	between regional persistence time and the number of patches is consistent
	across all models studied; however, the form of the relationship
	is distinctly different among low, intermediate, and high dispersal
	rates. Under low and intermediate dispersal rates, regional persistence
	times increase logarithmically and exponentially (respectively) with
	increasing numbers of patches, whereas under high dispersal, the
	form of the relationship depends on local dynamics. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that the forms of these relationships, which give
	rise to the bell-shaped relationship between dispersal rate and persistence
	time, are a product of recolonization and the region-wide synchronization
	(or lack thereof) of population dynamics. Identifying such metapopulation
	attributes that impact extinction risk is of utmost importance for
	managing and conserving the earth's evermore fragmented populations.},
