Current Status of Infectious Diseases 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the 2004 Global Burden of Disease report of the world Health
 Organization, infectious disease is the leading cause of death of children
 and adolescents, and one of the main causes in adults.
 Infectious disease brings for six of the top 20 leading causes of death
 worldwide.
 In low-income countries, infectious disease represents six of the top 10
 most common causes of death.
 This thesis is proposed in the context when the world started struggling
 with a global recession and in the same time, many public health serious
 events have occurred in the world : SRAS in 2003, avian influenza in 2004
 or swine flu in 2009, etc.
 Besides, we had to face up to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

re-emerging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 infectious diseases that were thought to be waning.
 For example, particularly and quite surprisingly one of the vaccine-preventable
 diseases is measles that returned backs in all the world and much stronger
 than before.
 At the start of 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially stated
 global measles epidemic outbreak.
 In the first three months of the year 2014, there were about 56,000 cases
 of measles infections in 75 countries, particularly in southeast Asia and
 in Vietnam.
 More specially, in the United States, measles cases significantly rose
 in 2014, 14 years after national leaders stated that the disease had been
 disappeared within the country.
 There were 288 cases of measles reported in the U.S between Jan.
 1 and May 23, 2014 as in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:measlesUS20012014"

\end_inset

.
 To explain this sudden outbreak of the measles, epidemiologist found out
 that the reasons are strongly relative to international travel by unvaccinated
 people (particularly U.S.
 residents), and incomplete vaccination that the American government doesn't
 control.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the world has to face up new infectious diseases that were once
 unknown or already known in past but totally to be waning, such as Ebola
 epidemic, in the same year to the measles.
 The Ebola epidemic is the largest in human history, affecting almost all
 countries in West Africa.
 To date, the WHO have reported a total of 28,575 suspected cases and 11,313
 deaths.
 However, it is numbers in documents understated for the magnitude of the
 outbreak.
 Now, in Liberia, the government was officially stated Ebola-free in May
 2015, however new cases were found in late June and early July.
 The world suffered two large epidemics in the same year, this has stressed
 the importance of the epidemiological phenomena anticipation when diseases
 occur.
 Many studies proposed by the WHO, the Pasteur Institute and the Inserm
 in the field of environmental security have tried to understand disease
 phenomena and spread of disease over a territory, to better manage when
 diseases occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, infectious diseases is becoming more complex, and more variant.
 We are difficult to well control the spread of infectious diseases even
 vaccine-preventable diseases as meals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the current epidemic state of the world, the main reasons to explain
 the reemergence of old communicable diseases and the emergence of new ones
 as follows : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
changes of environment where we live in :
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(1) Increased movements of people, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2) expansion of international trade in foodstuffs and medicinal biological
 products, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(3) social and environmental changes linked to urbanization, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(4) deforestation, 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
These four reasons change rapidly the nature of the world where we live
 in, but our human is not becoming to.
 However, the main agents of infectious diseases such as bacterial, fungal,
 parasitic, and viral already rapidly adapt to new environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evolution of drugs that is used for the curative treatments of infectious
 disease, have become less effective and developed less slowly than the
 adaption of parasites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, we are preceding two great challenges : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we keep on promoting the evolution of antimicrobial resistance for infectious
 disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is necessary to understand the environmental factors that contribute
 to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases and the process
 of disease spread to develop tools that will enable detecting and monitoring
 of how diseases spread, so that they can be identified and controlled before
 these infectious disease become pandemics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the evolution of drugs is always slower than the adaption of parasites
 in environmental changes, thus now we focus on tools that will enable detecting
 and predicting diseases spread before they become pandemics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Disease Control Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi
 are key factors causing infectious diseases.
 The diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another,
 through a mediate environment or contaminated tools.
 As far as directly infectious diseases are concerned, meaning diseases
 directly transmitted from one person to another, we have some normal policies
 to prevent the spread of diseases such as vaccines, anti-viral medications,
 and quarantine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Quarantine: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Quarantine is a policy to protect the public of disease by separating and
 restricting the movement of people in community who have or may have a
 contagious disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Advantages: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Quarantine can be applied to humans as well as animals to protect the spread
 of disease.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quarantine simply is a precautionary measure that breaks the line of transmissio
n from infected individuals to others.
 This method allows health authorities to prevent further spread of a disease
 in the case the quarantined individual develops clinical symptoms of the
 disease of concern.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Disadvantages:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The main method of the quarantine is to separate and restrict the movement
 of people in community.
 This method really is effective in a public health to prevent spread of
 a disease.
 However it has to face adverse consequences for civil liberties (ethical
 and human rights) and economic status (border closures and travel restrictions).
 Big challenge is proposed how we can guarantee tradeoffs between personal
 freedom and public good in preparing for a pandemic.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash$
\end_inset

cite{choffnes2007ethical} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the case, disease has a long incubation period and do not have highly
 evident symptoms.
 Everything needs to be checked for suspected cases, so can be quite time
 consuming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quarantine is only effective as a PHYSICAL barrier to disease.
 Hence, it is not effective for disease of animal, particularly wild birds.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Anti-viral medications: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Antiviral medications usually are called drugs used specifically for treating
 viral infections.
 Antiviral drugs are medicines in form (pills, liquid, an inhaled powder,
 or an intravenous solution) that makes the ability of viruses decrease
 to reproduce.
 So, these drugs may help reduce the duration of symptoms caused by virus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Advantages :
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Antiviral drugs are recommended for both treatment and prevention of virus
 replication.
 For example, for influenza, within 48 hours of onset of flu symptoms, antiviral
 drugs work best, but they may still offer benefits when taken later.
 These medications may reduce the duration of flu by one to two days and
 prevent severe flu complications.
 Moreover, when you get the flu, the antiviral drugs is a best choose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Current antiviral drugs now are designed to help deal with HIV, herpes,
 viruses, the hepatitis b and C viruses, and influenza A and B viruses.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Disadvantages:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult, because viruses
 use the host's cells to replicate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Antiviral drugs sometimes are serious, particularly for children and newborn
 babies.
 It is necessary to speak with doctor before making any decisions about
 medications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Antiviral drugs only work best within when taken within 48 hours of onset
 of flu symptoms.
 It is not good to prevent diseases before taking diseases.
 For some diseases that have vaccines, antiviral drugs are a second method
 of defense to treat diseases if you get it.
 Vaccines are still the first and best way to prevent diseases.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Vaccination: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
A vaccine is understood as a biological preparation that provides active
 acquired immunity to a particular disease for our body.
 After having been vaccinated, we transport microorganisms in weakened or
 killed form of the microbe into our body.
 The body's immune system produces the right antibodies to recognize the
 germs as a threat, destroy them and keep a record of them.
 Because of that, when the disease occurs, our immune system can recognize
 and destroy with a better chance of success any of these germs that it
 later encounters.
 In past, vaccination has greatly helped human beings.
 The vaccination of influenza, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and chicken pox
 have been particularly appreciated.
 Smallpox is a particular example.
 It was a big black point in human history during the closing years of the
 18th century.
 Smallpox killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually and among the people
 that luckily survived, a third had been blinded by the disease.
 However, the WHO officially stated the eradication of smallpox in 2011
 
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash$
\end_inset

cite{tognotti2010SmallpoxErad,fenner2001SmallpoxErad}.
 Many infectious diseases are clearly restricted such as influenza, polio,
 measles and tetanus from much of the world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The biggest benefit of vaccine is individual immunity: It provides long-term,
 sometimes lifelong protection against a disease.
 The vaccines recommended in the early childhood immunization schedule protect
 children from common infectious diseases worldwide (measles, chicken pox
 and other illnesses).
 As children grow older, additional vaccines protect them from diseases
 that affect adolescents and adults, as well as for diseases they may encounter
 during travel to other regions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The secondary benefit of vaccination, is herd immunity (or called also community
 immunity).
 When vaccination rates in a community is high, so herd immunity can protect
 people who are unable to receive vaccinations (including newborns and individua
ls with chronic illnesses) from diseases.
 Hence, it is difficult for the disease to gain an outbreak in the community.
 Vaccination has greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vaccination is different from giving medicine to an unwell child to make
 them better.
 The benefits of vaccination are invisible.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Disadvantages:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The ability of disease outbreak strongly depends on community vaccination
 rates.
 Widespread disease outbreaks can occur if the vaccination rates drop below
 the threshold of herd immunity.
 Thus, the problem about the vaccination rates is a big problem for countries
 that have complex geographic system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Deciding not to vaccinate children puts them at risk of catching a range
 of potentially serious, even fatal, diseases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Expensive.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In short, we find that among three policies to prevent spread of diseases,
 the vaccination policies bring more benefits than two methods left.
 The vaccination policies build a complete immune system against diseases
 for children in long-term or lifelong.
 Moreover, vaccines can prevent spread of disease in an entire community.
 Due to two strong benefits, the vaccination programmes have been deployed
 in the world.
 However, according to the U.S.
 childhood vaccination schedule for children between birth and six years,
 14 different diseases are recommended for immunizations.
 14 base vaccines must vaccinate children in an obligatory age is a very
 difficult financial problem for governments as well as parents in low-income
 countries.
 To solve the financial problem and at the same time to prevent the disease
 outbreak in the world, WHO always try to provide more free vaccines for
 poor countries.
 But nowadays, no infectious disease is completely eradicated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One question is posed why the human is still facing up to infectious diseases
 when most of common infectious disease have vaccines.
 It is obvious that the thorough knowledge of the disease is essential in
 order to implement large-scale proper infection control measures and prevention
 campaigns.
 The disease transmission methods depend on the characteristics of each
 disease and the nature of the microorganism that causes it.
 However, as mentioned above, vaccination rates strongly influences the
 ability of disease outbreak in the community.
 If in a community, the rate of vaccinated individuals is more than 80%,
 so this community is completely protected from a disease.
 But, in fact, it is very rare to have a community of 80% vaccinated individuals
, and more rarely in pour countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our current mass policy (for example the routine measles vaccination policy
 for measles) that vaccinates the maximum number of children before a certain
 age, is the oldest (started from the 1950s in the rich countries) and is
 now the most used.
 The policy has obtained main result that is a clear decrease of the incidence
 in most countries.
 However, due to the nature of this mass policy, the problem of this vaccination
 policy is too expensive, really ineffective and quite impossible to implement
 in poor countries, especially in Africa because of both financial and logistica
l problems.
 (e.g.
 the WHO project "Extended Program on Immunization" in Vietnam for the measles
 extinction before 2012 failed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the challenge is posed that there is a way that can help us predict
 the effective of a vaccination policy before we place it.
 Because, in fact when a vaccination policy is performed in a country, there
 is only one policy deployed.
 One single policy is placed in a community and after a couple of years
 we can start evaluating the effective of the policy.
 This is very expensive and loses time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Need a tool new optimal vaccination policies in artificial intelligence
 in order that these policies may become more effective, less expensive,
 and take into account the spatial dimension for all popular infectious
 diseases.
 Modeling tools are proposed to simulate disease transmission dynamics of
 vaccine-preventable diseases and to investigate and predict the effect
 of vaccination policies on the spread of diseases in the entire world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Current Modeling Tools 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we know, increased movements of people world-wide is the leading factor
 of the ability of spread of infectious disease.
 Recent works have shown that infectious diseases can spread and outbreak
 in space [9, 15, 35, 37].
 There are many factors that affect the spread in space such as: local factors
 (demographic including population size [19], growth rate and death rate
 [7], sociological such as school period of children, work tendency from
 rural to urban, environmental and climatic comprising seasonal variations
 in seasonality [8, 17], temperature and rainfall, immunological for diseases,
 etc...), and global factors (the connections between the different populations
 (i.e.
 spatial structure) [40] such as distance [19], coupling rate, number of
 individuals between populations, etc....).
 Hence, knowledge of these factors is very difficult, but extremely essential
 to inform models and computational efforts.
 It is the reason why there are few empirical studies available that provide
 estimates of the number and duration of contacts between subpopulations
 in a metapopulation.
 Moreover, the role of the infectious disease modeling has a big signification
 for us.
 For examples, due to these, we can simulate the spread of infectious diseases
 in subpopulations, the interaction among subpopulations.
 We can observe and understand the emergent dynamics of epidemics.
 Then, we can predict and anticipate the scales of infectious disease dynamics.
 Thus, we can give proper policies to minimize the infected number and better
 manage when diseases occur.
 Hence, there are already some packages in R that support us doing simulations,
 such as : 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adaptivetau
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GillespieSSA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EpiDynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These packages allow us to simulate dynamics of epidemics.
 However, they have many disadvantages: (1) simulation in R is naturally
 slow, (2) these packages don't perform modeling for a meta-population of
 many subpopulations, so simulating the dynamics of a meta-population is
 very difficult, and the time to implement simulations is very big, (3)
 R uses virtual memory to hold objects, this causes design limitations on
 great objects, hence users see always issues in R memory, specially anyone
 who works with large datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, challenge to us is to create a tool that permits us to model
 infectious disease dynamics in a metapopulation, to hurry up simulations,
 and become a useful tool to support decision of public healthy policies
 used by health professionals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation of thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is proposed in epidemic context where many infectious diseases
 such as measles, dengue in Asia and most countries of southeast Asia are
 more and more seriously occurring in incidence and geographic range; and
 there are emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika.
 Besides, the mass policy, the oldest and still most widely used in the
 world, is to vaccinate a maximal number of children before a certain age.
 This policy is already obtaining a significant decrease about the incidence
 in many countries.
 However, it is too expensive, ineffective and absolutely impossible to
 implement in many poor and low-income countries, in particular in Africa,
 Southeast Asia because of financial and logistical problems.
 On the other hand, the number of the tool supporting prediction of disease
 spread is still limited.
 Hence, there are many challenges pointed to this thesis.
 The first urgent request is to propose an efficient algorithm for optimizing
 vaccination policies evaluated by spacial and stochastic simulation.
 More urgently, we must have an informatics tool supporting decision of
 vaccination policies used by health professionals available in the form
 of an R package that can integrate R and C++ to speed up simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we will focus on modeling of popular infectious diseases
 with transmission by direct contact.
 This transmission requires a close contact between an infected person and
 a susceptible person, such as touching an infected individual, kissing,
 sexual contact with oral saliva, or contact with body lesions.
 These diseases usually occur between members of the same household or close
 friends and family.
 In particular, this thesis will mostly focus on measles.
 Measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus.
 It is a typical infectious disease with direct transmission.
 In 1980, approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6$
\end_inset

 million people was killed each year before we had the widespread vaccination
 policies.
 It spreads very fast by coughing and sneezing in human communities via
 close interpersonal contact or direct contact with secretions.
 Its main symptoms consist of high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.
 These first symptoms usually take from 
\begin_inset Formula $10$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $12$

 days after exposure to an infectious person, and lasts

.
 Nowadays, there is no proper treatment for measles to totally prevent the
 spread of measles except routine measles vaccination policy for children.
 According to the report by the WHO, since 2002 measles was eradicated from
 U.S.
 However, today measles vaccination has not been extensively popularized
 in the entire world.
 Beside the obtained results, for example, in 2013, there was about 84
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash$
\end_inset

% of the world's children having received one dose of measles vaccine, and
 during 2000-2013, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 15.6 million
 deaths; we have had to face up about 145700 measles deaths globally-estimated
 400 deaths every day or 16 deaths every hour in 2013.
 Measles becomes one of the leading causes of death among young children
 in the world, although now we are having a big stock of safe and readily
 available measles vaccines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, build a tool to optimize vaccination policies in order that these
 policies may become more effective, less expensive, and take into account
 the spatial dimension for all popular infectious diseases, in particular
 fir measles.

Spatial structures for metapopulation model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For directly transmitted infectious diseases by virus and bacteria, susceptible
 individuals are not only infected by infected individuals in the same location,
 but also by other infected individuals due to the movement of individuals
 between populated regions.
 This is one very important part in the domain studying the geographical
 spread of infectious diseases.
 We care for host population characteristics, then characteristics of spatial
 spread of an infectious disease among populations.
 Through these characteristics, we find optimal policies to minimize the
 number of infected individuals in a community.
 In fact, there are many studies about the interactions among populations.
 However, we can divide the spatial structure of populations into two main
 levels: "inter-city level" and "intra-city level".
 At the inter-city level (or called "micro-level"), we use differential
 equations to control its models.
 At the "intra-city level" ( also called "macro-level") in which we provide
 connections between the populations, simulate the intra-city traffic.
 We consider the effect of travel through the connections between population
 regions as a means of spreading a virus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "shaw2010effective"

\end_inset

.
 Focusing on the "macro-level", we have two basic models considered : (1)
 the model has no explicit movement of individuals and (2) the models describes
 enough travels and movements of individuals among populations and even
 takes into account the resident population as well as the current population
 of individuals

\begin_layout Standard
A population may be simplified as a city, community, or some other geographical
 region.
 Population travel (e.g.
 among animals and among people by foot, birds, mosquitoes and in particular,
 people travel by air from one city to another), is the main reason why
 diseases can spread quickly among very distant cities such as SARS disease
 in 2003.
 Therefore, the term "metapopulation" arrived in the ecological literature
 in 1969 by Levins 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969,hanski1991metapopulation"

\end_inset

.
 A metapopulation is a population of a set of spatially discrete local populatio
ns (or subpopulations in short) with mutual interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

.
 In the metapopulation in which a subpopulation can only go extinct locally
 and be recolonized by another after it is emptied by extinction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hanski1998,Levins1969"

\end_inset

 and migration between subpopulaitons is significantly restricted.
 In a metapopulation, if recolonization rates are smaller than extinction
 rates, then total extinction of all local population will easily be reached.
 The persistence time of the metapopulation is measured as the time until
 all subpopulations go extinct.
 According to Harrison (1991) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 there are four types of spatially dynamic populations : classic Levins

It is evident that smaller sub-populations have a high probability of local
 extinction, but the mainland population will hardly become extinct.
 The migration from the mainland to the islands is independent of the islands
 white or filled, but is propagated for the connected islands.
 Therefore, if the mainland population has a low individual density and
 there is no immigration, then population growth rate is positive.
 Inversely, if island populations are in the same conditions as the mainland,
 then its population growth rate is negative.
 Thus, the islands would go down to extinction if there are no immigrants.

\begin_layout Standard
We already have four metapopulation models.
 In order to model the metapopulations mentioned above, we have three main
 model to implement : spatially-implicit model, spatially-explicit model
 and spatially-realistic model.
 For the first model, this is the type of model used in Levins (1969) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

 in which supposing that all local populations are connected with each other
 and they have independent local fluctuations.
 At any one time, we save track of the proportion of local populations and
 we do not take care the distance between them and the population size of
 each subpopulation.
 This model are mathematically and conceptually easy to implement.
 But this model can only answer some metapopulation problems because it
 ignores so many variables of a metapopulation.
 This model should be used for metapopulation close to a steady state.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The spatially-explicit model
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For the second model, the spatially-explicit model is more complex than
 the first model.
 Subpopulations may be filled or vacant.
 Local populations only have interactions with the nearest neighbors.
 Subpopulations are organized as cells on a grid and migration among them
 depends on population density.
 We also only consider presence or absence of a species in each subpopulation.
 The advantage of this model is easy to model because of same local behaviors
 from subpopulation to subpopulation.
 However, we cannot simply describe the state of the metapopulation through
 filled subpopulations.
 Finally, the spatially-realistic model uses GIS to realize attributes,
 geometric coordinates, etc ...
 to a metapopulation.
 The first author using this model is Hanski in 1994 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hanski1994practical"

\end_inset

.
 His model was defined as the incidence function (IF) model.
 This model is more realistic, and we can estimate quantitative predictions
 about metapopulation fluctuation.
 However, in fact, this model is very complicated, and many geographic data
 have to be estimated.
 Hence, the metapopulation concept start to no longer exist.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In the scope of this thesis, we focus on a metapopulation model that is
 result of combination between the spatially-explicit model and the patchy
 population.
 In general, this a simple spatial model, but is one of the most applicable
 model to descrire spread of diseases in human communities.
 This metapopulation consists of distinct subpopulations, each of which
 fluctuates independently, together with interaction limited by a coupling
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

.
 These subpopulations may be filled or empty and contact with any neighbours.

Epidemic models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that, there are many current models that are used to model complex
 systems in nature, in ecology system and in epidemiology.
 Mathematical models in epidemiology are a typical example.
 These models permit us to present behavior of diseases and disease process
 in mathematics.
 However, explaining the transmission of infectious diseases is a difficult
 problem for an epidemiologist.
 Because there are many different interacting factors causing the outbreak
 of diseases such as the environment, the climate, the geography, the culture,...He
nce, the role of the epidemiologist is how to model the characteristics
 and the transmission process of an infectious disease.
 Researchers have proposed compartmental models in epidemiology by dividing
 the population into ‚Äúcompartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that illustrate health states of human through individuals.
 These compartmental models are called the epidemic models too.
 The first benefit of these models is to model the transmission process
 of a communicable disease through compartments.
 Then, we can predict the properties of the disease dynamics such as the
 estimated number of infected individual, the time of persistence of disease,
 further that where and when we can implement vaccination policies to have
 both a minimum number of vaccined individuals and the minimum number of
 infected individuals in a given population.
 Let image that now in your country, there is an infectious disease as measles,
 a baby can be infected.
 According to the process of infection of disease, firstly this baby was
 born, he is fine and he is not infected yet by the measles but he may be
 infected in the future.
 We say that he belongs to the susceptible group (in short, S).
 Then, his mother takes him to a supermarket, there he see so many people,
 he is really infected through any way.
 He starts having a high fever, he may have to pass this state from 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 days to 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 days.
 In this period, he is really infected but he cannot infected others.
 We say that he belong to the exposed group (in short, E).
 After that, he start decreasing the temperature, but at the same time,
 he begins having red rashes on the back of the ears, after a few hours,
 on the head, on the neck and finally most of the body.
 This period appears from five to eight days after the exposed step.
 This duration is very sensible.
 The baby is completely infected and he can infected others if they see
 him.
 He belongs to the infected group (in short, I).
 Finally, he passes to the final period, he comes back good state.
 We say that he belongs to the recovered group with immunity (in short,
 R).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Around these four main health groups presenting the process of infection
 propagation in community, there are many epidemic models proposed.
 We give here the development of epidemic models by focusing on acute infections
, assuming the pathogen causes illness for a periods of time followed by
 (typically lifelong) immunity.
 The first simplest model is the S-I-R model created by W.
 O.
 Kermack and A.
 G.
 McKendrick in 1927.
 The authors categorized hosts within groups as described above 
\series bold
S
\series default
usceptible (if not yet exposed to the pathogen), 
\series bold
I
\series default
nfected (if currently infected by the pathogen) and 
\series bold
R
\series default
ecovered (if they have successfully cleared the infection).
 From the simplest SIR model, in order to accord each infectious disease
 and real property of disease, scientists have modified it, made it different
 multiform.
 However, in shape of this thesis, we concentrate on the SEIR model (as
 the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) that fit many currently infectious diseases in the world.
 Each patient must pass four health steps : susceptible stage, incubation
 stage, infectious stage and recovered stage.

In detail, the deterministic model performs the same way for a given set
 of initial conditions.
 It doesn't have randomness, dynamics, and don't present dynamic of diseases
 in nature.
 Thus, stochastic models have been proposed.
 A stochastic model is always more realistic than a deterministic one.
 These models have stochastic and variable states are not described by unique
 values, but by probability distributions.
 It is why we will use the stochastic models to predict extinction probability
 of disease in spatial context

Algorithms of stochastic simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stochastic simulation works on variables that both are random and can be
 changed with certain probability.
 Today, these stochastic models have been used widely in many domain because
 of some reasons as following : before, in order to model chemically reacting
 systems, in simple way, we solved a set of coupled ordinary differential
 equations (ODEs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "li2007stochastic"

\end_inset

 of deterministic approaches.
 Basically, these approaches use the law of mass action that shows a simple
 relation between reaction rate and molecular component concentrations.
 We start with a given set of initial molecular concentrations, the law
 of mass action permits us to see the component concentrations over time.
 The states of a reaction are a homogeneous, free medium.
 The reaction rate will be directly scaled with the concentrations of the
 elements.
 Most systems can use the traditional deterministic approaches to simulate.
 It is evident that many systems such as some biochemical systems consist
 of random, discrete interactions between individual elements.
 However, in the case, these systems becomes smaller and smaller, the traditiona
l deterministic models may not be accurate.
 It is the reason for that the fluctuations of these systems can be simulated
 exactly by applying stochastic models, particularly as well as the Stochastic
 Simulation Algorithms (SSA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSA uses Monte Carlo (MC) methods to study the time evolution of the
 jump process.
 Because the basis feature of the Monte Carlo simulation is insensitive
 to the dimensionality of the problem, and the work grows linearly with
 the number of reaction channels in the model.
 The SSA describes time-evolution statistically correct trajectories of
 finite populations in continuous time by solving the corresponding stochastic
 differential equations.
 Using the stochastic models can solve three questions.
 (1) These models take account the discrete character of the number of elements
 and the evidently random character of collision among elements.
 (2) They coincide with the theories of the dynamic and stochastic processes.
 (3) They are a good idea to describe "small systems" and "instable systems".
 The main idea of the stochastic models is that element reactions are essentiall
y random processes.
 We don't know certainly how a reaction occur at a moment.
 We also call it the process stochasticity.
 In particular, in the process stochasticity, we talk about demographic
 and environmental stochasticities in epidemic models.
 The demographic stochasticity is strongly controlled by population size
 such as the birth and death rates, contamination, etc.
 But, the environmental stochasticity is just affected by environmental
 factors what we can not govern.
 Therefore, there are many epidemic models that forcus on exploration of
 demographic stochasticity.
 Demographic stochasticity is considered as fluctuation in population processes
 that are based the random nature of events at the level of the individual.
 Each event is related to one baseline probability fixed, individuals are
 presented in differing fates due to chance.
 In addition to the demographic stochasticity, the number of infectious,
 susceptible, exposed and recovered individuals is now required to be an
 integer.
 Modeling approaches that incorporate demographic stochasticity are called
 event-driven methods.
 These methods require explicit consideration of events.
 The first approach published by Daniel T.Gillespie in 1976 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1976general"

\end_inset

 is an exact stochastic simulation approach for chemical kinetics.
 The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) has become the standard
 procedure of the discrete-event modelling by taking proper value of the
 available randomness in such a system.
 The methods modelling the event-driven model demands explicit presentation
 of events.
 For the standard SEIR model, we have to consider the nine events that can
 occur, each causing the numbers in the relative groups to go up or down
 by one.

The key property for a discrete event simulation of a Markovian system basically
 samples a time for the next event from this distribution and selecting
 the reaction that occurs at that time.

We can find that on each step, the Direct Method has to generate two random
 numbers.
 Supposing that generate one random number takes 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{rand}$
\end_inset

 time.
 Hence, on each step, the DM takes 
\begin_inset Formula $(2C_{rand}+O(n))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 is time to search the index 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of the next reaction channel.
 For this reason, the DM is more efficient than the FRM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gillespie algorithm plays an very important role and has become a fundamenta
l method in computational systems biology.
 Hence, many efforts have been proposed to improve its efficiency.
 The key step in the DM is to choose the next reaction channel to implement.
 This step applies a linear search with a complexity 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of occurred event in the system.
 Many methods have focused on this step to improve and give more efficient
 formulations.
 For example, Maksym in 1988 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "maksym1988fast"

\end_inset

 separated the set of reactions into subsets with a complexity of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{1/2})$
\end_inset

.
 In 1995, Blue et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 extended the division approach of Maksym, where a 
\begin_inset Formula $K-level$
\end_inset

 method results in a search time proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{1/K}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, in taking K to the limit, they applied a binary tree structure and
 obtained the complexity 
\begin_inset Formula $O(logR)$

In 2000, Gibson and Bruck successful transformed the algorithm FRM into
 an equivalent but more efficient new structure.
 The Next Reaction Method applies just a single random number per iteration.
 Moreover, the initiation times of the reactions can be set as the firing
 times of independent, unit rate Poisson processes with internal times given
 by integrated propensity functions.
 It is evaluated steady faster than the FRM and more efficient than DM in
 special cases as the system includes many species and loosely coupled reaction
 channels.

The data structure presented in the NRM is a dependency graph.
 Because a propensity function 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j}$
\end_inset

 should be modified when a given reaction is implemented.
 A node in the graph is correspondent to a reaction channel.
 A directed edge of the reactions 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

 points out that the execution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 really affects the molecules in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the the dependency graph, in step 4, the number of propensity functions
 recalculated is minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the indexed priority queue is similar to a heap tree in computer
 science.
 It is a tree that includes ordered pairs of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,\tau_{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is both the reaction channel index and the position in the tree, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the corresponding time when the new 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 reaction is expected to occur.
 In the tree, the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of each parent is a smaller than that of its children.
 The top node of the tree is always the minimum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and the order is only vertical.
 In each step, the nodes of the tree will change its positions according
 to its value to get the new priority queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, the NRM solved two additional optimizations : (1) by switching
 to absolute time, Gibson and Bruck reduced the number of random numbers
 needed in each step from two to one; (2) because of the use of a dependency
 graph, the number of propensities needing to be recomputed for every time
 step is minimum.
 In estimating the computation time of the NRM, we find that, for every
 reaction channel, the time until that reaction occurs is computed, maintained
 in an indexed priority queue, and efficiently implemented as a binary heap.
 However, the cost for maintaining the priority queue is relatively high.
 The time to select the next event is done in constant time, but the time
 to update the propensities is done in logarithmic time.
 Hence, the NRM is commonly used for systems with many reaction channels
 and where relatively few propensities change with each reaction.
 The disadvantage of the NRM is that diffusion is added to the models and
 the reaction-diffusion master equation is simulated, so systems arise.
 For such models, in 2004, Elf et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 proposed a variant of the NRM that is called the Next Subvolume Method
 (NSM).
 This method can be referred as a clever association of the ideas of NRM
 and Maksym's method for intracellular 3D chemical reaction systems.

Compare the direct method (DM) to the next reaction method (NRM), which
 algorithm is most efficient?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We find that in the NRM, after the executed first initial step, all sequent
 time steps only ask one random number to be generated while the DM requests
 two.
 Even, the search step for the index 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of the next reaction channel takes 
\begin_inset Formula $O(M)$
\end_inset

 time for DM, but the corresponding task of updating the indexed priority
 queue takes 
\begin_inset Formula $log(M)$
\end_inset

.
 It is the reason for that the NRM is always evaluated more efficient for
 large scale problems.
 To evaluate the real cost of two methods (NRM and DM) based on the total
 simulation time, Yang Cao et al.

, which includes 28 variables and 61 reactions.
 The experimental resultats pointed out that the average simulation time
 for DM is larger than that for NRM due to its data structure maintenance.
 In particular, for the loose coupling system where the components (or elements)
 in a system are interconnected and dependant on each other to the least
 extent practicable, NRM works better than DM.
 Yang et al.
 found that three main factors that strongly affect the CPU cost, are the
 costs, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 propensities, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a_{0}}$
\end_inset

to calculate the sum of all propensity probabilities, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 to search for a event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, to reduce these costs, Yang et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cao2004"

\end_inset

 suggested that a new optimization called the Optimized Directed Method
 (ODM).
 They found that in a reaction set of a system, some reactions fire much
 more frequently than others.
 To reduce the search time 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

, they arranged the index of the reaction ordering, placing the most frequently
 occurring events first based on how often they fire, combined with a dependency
 graph, achieves better results than the NRM for moderately large systems.
 Their optimized direct method (ODM) gives a new search depth smaller than
 the original method DM.
 The obtained result is that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 can be significantly declined.
 In the next step to reduce the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

, the authors used an idea from the method NRM.
 The ODM only recomputes the propensities for those reaction channels affected
 by the last reaction.
 Because of an extra cost used for accessing the dependency graph, so this
 approach applies only to loose-coupling systems.
 In conclusion, the obtained results of Yang et al.
 have shown that the ODM is faster than NRM, in particular, unless the system
 is very nearly uncoupled.
 This result broken the held belief for a long time that NRM was the fastest.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Through this result, we can say that the efficiency of the ODM, currently
 is evaluated to be the fastest known algorithm for stochastic simulation
 for most biological problems.
 This method can be negatively impacted by transient shifts in the frequency
 at which reactions occur, and commonly used in biochemical reaction networks
 because of the inductive and repressive nature of genetic regulation.
 Due to these shifts, the ODM defeats the pre-simulation strategy employed
 within the ODM to decrease the time complexity of the SSA's reaction selection
 step and thus degrade performance.
 In order to decrease this degradation, in 2005, McCollum et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mccollum2006sorting"

\end_inset

 introduced the sorting direct method (SDM) that improves on ODM.
 This method eliminates the pre-simulations required by the ODM and permits
 the simulator to adapt to sharp changes in reaction execution frequencies.
 The common point of these two methods is to focus on the optimization of
 the system instead of the method itself by reducing the average number
 of operations required to obtain the index of the next reaction to fire.
 This average number of operations is called the search depth that is highly
 dependent on the biochemical system.
 For these two methods, the search depth us 
\begin_inset Formula $O(M)$
\end_inset

.
 Besides, within the paper of McCollum et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mccollum2006sorting"

\end_inset

, the authors also gave a detailed overview of the difference in the implementat
ion of DM, NRM, ODM and SDM.
 In 2006, Li and Petzold introduced an alternative formulation of the SSA,
 named the Logarithmic Direct Method (LDM).
 In this method, the computational cost is independent of the ordering of
 the reactions and no need for a pre-simulation.
 The LDM declined the search depth to 
\begin_inset Formula $O(logM)$
\end_inset

, and pointed out the efficiency of the logarithmic method.

Approximate methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the methods Direct, First Reaction and Next Reaction
 are all exact stochastic approaches of the underlying ordinary differential
 equations.
 Their advantage give us a really mathematically exact approach to simulate
 time-to-event model (in condition that the definition of the propensity
 functions accurately reflects the dynamics of the system).
 But, their disadvantages are 1) noise in exact simulations only affects
 the probabilities associated with fates of individuals and the updating
 of each consecutive event is independent ‚Äì there is no assumption concerning
 environmental stochasticity; 2) these exact solutions become too slow and
 impractical when any one transition rate is large, when there is a big
 number of subpopulations or one a big number of event in a metapopulation;
 because the exact algorithms SSA must proceed one reaction at a time and
 take the task of explicitly simulating each and every reaction event, hence
 they are much too slow for most practical problems.
 It is the reason for that, approximate models have been proposed instead
 of the exact stochastic methods.
 The approximate approaches ask the question : "How many times does each
 action channel fire in each subinterval?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These approaches could be used in larger systems, and made much faster than
 the exact methods.
 However, the exact structure of the Markov chain is no longer simulated
 in the approximate approaches, hence the validity of the approximations
 become a main issue.
 Now we will show some mostly used approximate methods.

 How do we choose the value fixed of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

? 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 must satisfy two conditions, large enough so that many reaction events
 occur in that time and small enough of the leap condition.
 The leap condition is pointed out that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: For the current state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$

 is asked to be small enought that the modification in the state during
 
\begin_inset Formula $[t,t+\delta t]$
\end_inset

 will be so small that no propensity function will suffer an appreciable
 change in its value.
 Thus, the key to the success of this technique is to choose a leap size
 large enough to allow many reactions to occur during the leap (reducing
 computation) and small enough that none of the propensity functions will
 change significantly in value (causing an error).
 Cao et al.

\begin_inset Formula $(0<\epsilon\ll1)$

 In short, the best advantage of the

 method is to speed up the stochastic simulation for many

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 systems 
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

i.e., systems in which the difference between the characteristic time scales

 However, the number of firings of each reaction channels during a fixed
 time step 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 is approximated as a Poisson random variable.
 This Poisson variable can have arbitrarily large sample values.
 Hence, there exists the possibility that this

 method will cause one or more reaction channels to fire so many times during
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 that number of reactants in each population will be became negative, in
 particular in systems with multiple timescales (for short the stiff systems).
 Due its obtained advantage, so this technique has continued to mature,
 specially in the area of leap-size selection, through the work of a variety
 of researchers : procedure for determining the maximum leap size for a

 In detail for the binomial leaping method, this method replaces the Poisson
 random variables with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally
 bounded.
 However, the disadvantage of this method appeared when the system is in
 the state : there are multiple reactions with common consumed reactants,
 so the issues of the binomial tau-leaping strategy have not yet been fully
 resolved, and to write a general binomial tau-leaping program that reliably
 handles all situations that could possibly arise, this task would seem
 to be a very challenging task.
 It is the reason for that, Yang et al.

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above in the part 1.1.3, we pointed out that the infectious disease
 modeling plays a big role for us.
 Modelings present the dynamics of infectious diseases, the spread of infectious
 diseases in subpopulations, and the interaction among subpopulations.
 We can observe and understand the emergent dynamics of epidemics.
 We can predict and anticipate the scales of infectious disease dynamics.
 Thus, we can give proper policies to minimize the infected number and better
 manage when diseases occur, and at the same time we assess the effectiveness
 of control strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the reason for that in recent years mathematical modeling has become
 a valuable tool in the analysis of infectious disease dynamics and to support
 the development of control strategies.
 Many simulation software as well as packages are proposed to help scientists
 observe fluctuations of infectious diseases over time.
 These tools simulate epidemic models either by dealing with a set of ordinary
 differential equations (ODEs) or by applying the stochastic simulation
 algorithm (SSA) of Gillespie.
 Simple epidemic models work well on these software tools such as packages

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the accuracy, the simulation speed, and the complexity of models
 that the tools can simulate are three main drawbacks that always prompt
 us not to stop improving tools to increase efficient implementations available
 in software tools.
 Rather than dynamics of infectious diseases, predicting the potential spread
 of an infectious disease in a meta-population is the most difficult problem
 for scientists.
 To give an exact prediction about propagation of infectious diseases in
 a meta-population, we need to make simulations in a complex meta-population
 with many interconnected sub-populations where the meta-population takes
 into account many factors about the pathogen, the climatic conditions and
 simultaneously the interactions between sub-populations.
 Therefore, the challenge to us is to create a tool that permits us to model
 infectious disease dynamics in a metapopulation, to hurry up simulations,
 and become a useful tool to support decision of public healthy policies
 used by health professionals.
 In this thesis, we introduce the "dizzys" package that allows us to exactly
 simulate and accurately analyze dynamics of an infectious disease in a
 meta-population of interconnected sub-populations by using two basic and
 common disease models SIR and SEIR, and by implementing the direct algorithm
 of Gillespie in 1977 and the adaptive tau leaping to approximate the trajectory
 of a continuous-time stochastic process.
 In addition, on the technical aspect, this package integrates C++ in R,
 we use C++ to build algorithms, and use R to show two-dimensional and three-dim
ensional interfaces and use the available statistic functions in R to analyze
 obtained results.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fundamentally, Kermack-McKendrick gave the first epidemic model to provide
 a mathematical description of the kinetic transmission of an infectious
 disease in an unstructured sub-population.
 Due to this model, today we have known well the SIR and SEIR deterministic
 epidemic models.
 These two basic epidemic models are very popularly used by scientists.
 The reactions in the system are modelled by a set of Ordinary Differential
 Equations (ODEs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "li2007stochastic"

\end_inset

.
 The deterministic method is the simplest to solve an epidemic model.
 The main idea of this method is to solve a single differential equation
 per species of the model.
 Basically, the deterministic method uses the law of mass action that has
 applicability in many areas of science.
 In chemistry, it is also called Fundamental Law of Chemical Kinetics (the
 study of rates of chemical reactions), introduced by the Norwegian scientists
 Cato M.
 Guldberg in 1864-1879 and Peter Waage.
 The law of mass action shows a simple relation between reaction rate and
 molecular component concentrations.
 For a set of initial molecular concentrations given, the law of mass action
 permits us to see the component concentrations over time.
 The states of a reaction are a homogeneous, free medium.
 The reaction rate will be directly scaled with the concentrations of the
 elements.
 Most systems can use the traditional deterministic approaches to simulate.
 It is evident that many systems such as some biochemical systems consist
 of random, discrete interactions between individual elements.
 In fact, we have applied the deterministic model in the epidemiology to
 solve epidemic models such as the SEIR and SIR models.
 However, in the case, these systems become smaller and smaller, the traditional
 deterministic models may not be accurate.
 In addition, in the deterministic approach, the time evolution of a reacting
 system is assumed that it is both continuous and deterministic.
 But in fact, molecular population levels can change only by discrete integer
 amounts.
 It is the reason for that this time evolution is not both a continuous
 process and a discrete process.
 Indeed, the deterministic approach is impossible to predict the exact molecular
 population levels at some future times unless we can compute exactly the
 precise positions and velocities of all molecules in the system.
 It is the reason for that the fluctuations of these systems can be simulated
 exactly by applying stochastic models via Stochastic Simulation Algorithms
 (SSA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1976general,gillespie1977exact"

\end_inset

.
 The SSA uses Monte Carlo (MC) methods to study the time evolution of the
 jump process.
 Because the basis feature of the Monte Carlo simulation is insensitive
 to the dimensionality of the problem, and the work grows linearly with
 the number of reaction channels in the model.
 The SSA describes time-evolution statistically correct trajectories of
 finite populations in continuous time by solving the corresponding stochastic
 differential equations.
 Using the stochastic models can solve three questions.
 (1) These models take account the discrete character of the number of elements
 and the evidently random character of collision among elements.
 (2) They coincide with the theories of the dynamic and stochastic processes.
 (3) They are a good idea to describe "small systems" and "unstable systems".
 The main idea of the stochastic models is that element reactions are essentiall
y random processes.
 We don't know certainly how a reaction occurs at a moment.
 We also call it the process stochasticity.
 Demographic stochasticity is considered as fluctuation in population processes
 that is based the random nature of events at the level of the individual.
 Each event is related to one baseline probability fixed, individuals are
 presented in differing fates due to chance.
 In addition to the demographic stochasticity, the number of infectious,
 susceptible, exposed and recovered individuals in a meta-population infected
 by an infectious disease is now required to be an integer.
 Modeling approaches that incorporate demographic stochasticity are called
 event-driven methods.
 These methods require explicit consideration of events.
 The first approach published by Daniel T.Gillespie in 1976 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1976general"

\end_inset

 is an exact stochastic simulation approach for chemical kinetics.
 The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) has become the standard
 procedure of the discrete-event modelling by taking proper value of the
 available randomness in such a system.
 The methods modelling the event-driven model demands explicit presentation
 of events.
 Therefore, the "dizzysNewInfec" package permits us to obtain the dynamics
 of the deterministic and the stochastic dynamics of two basic epidemic
 models SIR and SEIR.
 We use the exact algorithm of Gillespie in 1977 and the "adaptive tau-leaping"
 algorithm in the package.
 With these two algorithms, each has its private advantages and its private
 disadvantages.
 For the exact algorithm, it gives us a really exact approach of simulating
 population-based time-to-event through two steps with many iterations of
 1) searching the time of next event by an exponentially distributed function
 and 2) searching the nature of next event.
 Each single event in the Gillespie's solution is explicitly simulated,
 so this exact simulation becomes exceedingly slow and impractical in systems
 where the transition rate grows large over time.
 Hence, approximate models are born instead of the Gillespie's solution,
 they are concerned with larger transition rates and with increasing simulation
 speed while still maintaining reasonable accuracy.
 The "adaptive tau-leaping" algorithm known as an approximate method reduces
 the number of iterations by treating transition rates as constant over
 time periods for which this approximation leads to little error

The SEIR epidemic model used in our package have successful described hosts
 within a population as Susceptible (the number of individuals not yet infected
 with the disease), Exposed (the number of individuals who are infected
 with the disease but not infectious), Infected (the number of individuals
 who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the
 disease), and Recovered (the number of individuals who have successfully
 cleared the infection).
 We ignore population demography-births, deaths, and migration.
 So we have only three transitions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mbox{}\\
S & \rightarrow & E\\
E & \rightarrow & I\\
I & \rightarrow & R\\
\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is obvious that the second and third of these transitions are easier,
 so we focus on the first transition in which the level of the infectious
 disease influences strongly the disease transmission rate from a susceptible
 individual into the infected class.
 If this first step doesn't occur, all infected individuals can go to the
 recovered class.
 This first transition plays an important role in studying fluctuation of
 disease.
 Many researches have been tried to find the "infectious period" (the amount
 of time spent in the infectious class).
 They have found that for acute infections, the "infectious period" is distribut
ed around some mean values that we can estimate from clinical data.
 To present enough properties of the "infectious period" by formulations,
 we have to depend upon three main factors of the disease transmission from
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 : the prevalence of infecteds, the underlying population contact structure,
 and the probability of transmission given contact.
 For a directly transmitted disease, the key factor is the contact between
 susceptible and infected individuals.
 Hence, in this package "dizzysNewInfe", we interpret the "infectious period"
 in more detailed, and realistic contexts.
 We introduce a new formula of the probabilistic derivation of multipopulation
 epidemic model called NIIF.
 We study the case where agent 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 native from subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 visits sub-population 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 In a meta-population of sub-populations, during a small interval of time
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

, each native individual of the sub-population 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 visits one single sub-population 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 (with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

) and will see on average 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 These individuals come from all sub-populations.
 This is absolutely a new interpretation about the infection between individuals
 and the propagation of disease between sub-population.
 In previous research described in [keeling2011], the authors always assumed
 that both the number of people we meet and the number of infected people
 we meet are fixed.
 This assumption simplifies the relations between individuals and between
 sub-populations.
 It's the reason for that the formula of the infection force did not present
 clearly the complex connections between individuals and between sub-populations
 in a meta-population.
 In our interpretation, we assume that for each sub-population 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the number of people native from 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 that we meet during 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 follows a Poisson process.
 So both the number of people we meet and the number of infected people
 we meet during 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 should be random variables.

\begin_layout Standard
In short, the 
\series bold
dizzysNewInfec
\series default
 package implements both the exact solution and the approximate solution
 for the SIR and SEIR models.
 The package installs well the new interpretation of the infection force
 NIIF for SIR and SEIR meta-population models by integrating the R package
 and the C++ implementation.
 We can choose one of these two solutions to simulate when the number of
 sub-populations in a meta-population increases.
 Using C++ to perform the algorithms, and R to create interfaces makes the
 
\series bold

 package much faster and much easy to use than any pure R package.

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, we define the force of infection, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 for multi-population epidemic model which is referred as the per capita
 rate at which susceptible individuals contract the infection.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 directly scales the number of infectious individuals 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, for directly infectious diseases, disease transmission demands
 contact between infecteds and susceptibles.
 Hence, there are two proposed general possibilities based on how we present
 the contact structure to change with population size: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\beta I/N$
\end_inset

 applied when we want to mention frequency dependent (or mass action) transmissi
on, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\beta I$
\end_inset

 applied when we want to mention density dependent (or pseudo mass action)
 transmission, where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is the number of infectious individuals, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the total population size 
\begin_inset Formula $(N=S+E+I+R)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the product of the contact rates and transmission probability.
 In the shape of this thesis, we assume that the infection process is frequency-
dependent, meaning that the force of infection 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is proportional to a proportion of infected: 
\begin_inset Formula $I/N$
\end_inset

.
 Infection of susceptibles from one population 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can be due to contacts with infected from the same population 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or to contacts with infected from another population 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 In the next section, we will introduce a new mechanistic derivation of
 the transmission term in more detailed, and realistic way.

 One general question is always posed "how does the population of exposed
 individuals of subpopulation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 evolve ?".
 For the sake of simplicity, in the process of transmission of the SEIR
 model, we focus on the incidence and we assume for now that the latent

\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\sigma=0$

 Thus, we write a probabilistic formulation of

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The equilibrium state
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, we are interested in investigating the SEIR model with
 demography.
 This model is an extension of the epidemic simple SEIR model that allows
 for birth and death.
 Because, demographic processes play an important role for exploring the
 longer-term persistence and endemic dynamics of an infectious disease.
 In SEIR model with demography, assuming that the time scale of disease
 propagation is fast enough not to be affected by population births and
 deaths, the model is considered in the case with a constant birth rate
 and a constant per-capita death rate (that are independent of the population
 size).
 Now, we consider a meta-population of many subpopulations.
 Each subpopulation is modelled by a SEIR model with demography.
 Again, the ordinary differential equations for a 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 in a metapopulation is presented as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} & = & \mu N_{i}-\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu S_{i}\\
\frac{dE_{i}}{dt} & = & \lambda_{i}S_{i}-\mu E_{i}-\sigma E_{i}\\
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} & = & \sigma E_{i}-\mu I_{i}-\gamma I_{i}\\
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} & = & \gamma I_{i}-\mu R_{i}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simulation, we know that the equilibrium state allow a disease to persist
 in a population for a long time, and the variables do not change with time.
 So, an infectious disease in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 is available in long term this system is at equilibrium.
 It means that at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dS_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dE_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dI{}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{dR{}_{i}}{dt}=0$
\end_inset

 (*).
 Thus, we let all ordinary differential equations in the system be equal
 to zero, then calculate the values of the variables (now denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R{}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

) that satisfy this condition (*).
 We have these values as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}{\beta\sigma}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma+\mu}-\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta\sigma}\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\mu\frac{\beta\sigma-(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}{\beta(\sigma+\mu)(\gamma+\mu)}\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Here, if we set 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}=\frac{\beta\sigma}{(\gamma+\mu)(\sigma+\mu)}$
\end_inset

, so we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}\\
E_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)\\
I_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1)\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & N_{i}-S_{i}^{*}-E_{i}^{*}-I_{i}^{*}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One normal conditions for all population variables is that the equilibrium
 values cannot be negative.
 Therefore, an infectious disease is available in the 
\begin_inset Formula $subpopulation_{i}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0}>1$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the endemic equilibrium in the system is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(S_{i}^{*},E_{i}^{*},I{}_{i}^{*},R{}_{i}^{*})$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $(N_{i}\frac{1}{R_{0}}$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(1-\frac{1}{R_{0}}-\frac{\mu\sigma}{R_{0}}\left(R_{0}-1\right)-\frac{\mu}{\beta}(R_{0}-1))$

\begin_layout Paragraph
2.
 Stochastic models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stochastic model is built by depending upon the deterministic model.
 More detailed, this stochastic model relies on chance variation in risks
 of exposure, disease, and other factors.
 It is referred as an individual-level modeling, because every individual
 plays an important role in the model, so this stochastic model can consider
 well most small population size that the deterministic model can not do.
 To implement this SEIR stochastic model, there are many different methods.
 The first method "First Reaction Method" is born in 1976 by Gillespie.
 Then, according to this first method and these two key factors of demographic
 stochasticity models (event, randomness), many scientists have improved
 the first method, and created many better algorithms for stochastic simulations.
 There are two main types of methods, exact methods and approximative methods.
 The typical approach in exact methods most practitioners use, is the algorithm
 "Direct Method" of Gillespie(1977) improved from the first approach "First
 Reaction Method", and in approximative methods, is the "tau-leaping" method.
 For the Direct Method (Gillespie 1977), the first step estimates the time
 until the next event, by accumulating the rates of all possible events.
 Then, by transforming event rates into probabilities, the method randomly
 selects one of these events.
 The time and numbers in each class are then updated according to which
 event is chosen.
 We repeat this process to iterate model through time.
 For the "tau-leaping" method, the main crux is the use of Poisson random
 variables to approximate the number of occurrences of each type of reaction
 event during a carefully selected time period, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 .
 According to these two types of algorithms, the common point is both methods
 use continuous-time Markov process for which the transition rates are constants
, isn't a function of time.
 The future state of the process, is only conditional on the present state,
 but independent of the past.
 However, for the exact algorithm, its advantage give us a really exact
 approach to simulate time-to-event model.
 This process is repeated to iterate the mode.
 GibsonBruck(2000) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KeelingRohani2008"

\end_inset

 modified the first reaction method and created the Next Reaction method
 that substantially more challenging to program but is significantly faster
 than even the method when there are a large number of different event types.
 The Direct, First Reaction and Next Reaction methods are all exact stochastic
 approaches of the underlying ordinary differential equations.
 But, its disadvantages are 1) noise in exact simulations only affects the
 probabilities associated with fates of individuals and the updating of
 each consecutive event is independent ‚Äì there is no assumption concerning
 environmental stochasticity; 2) these exact solutions become too slow and
 impractical when any one transition rate is large, when there is a big
 number of sub-populations or one a big number of event in a meta-population.
 It is the reason for that, approximate models have been proposed instead
 of the exact stochastic methods.
 Gillespie (2001) has proposed a new method that decreases the simulation
 accuracy, but increases simulation speed.
 This is the "tau-leap method" known as an approximate method reduces the
 number of iterations by treating transition rates as constant over time
 periods for which this approximation leads to little error [KeelingRohani2008]
 as mentioned above.
 However, when we use the "tau-leap method", there is a possibility, the
 number of individual in each class can become negative.
 According to Keeling2008
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KeelingRohani2008"

\end_inset

, the authors compared these methods together, they pointed out that when
 the population size increases, the simulation time of the three methods
 (First Reaction, Direct Method, tau -leap ) is almost augmented.
 The simulation time of the method "First Method" is maximum, it means that
 this is the slowest method, but the simulation time of the method "tau-leap"
 is minimum or the fastest.
 In the shape of my package, we use the direct method to exactly estimate
 spread of diseases in meta-population.
 Because the direct method is one exact approach and its simulation time
 isn't too slow and too fast.
 We use the approximate method to speed up simulations in the case where
 there are many sub-populations in a meta-population.

\begin_layout Standard
To apply the Direct Method in a meta-population of n sub-populations, we
 know that at a moment 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there are only one single event fired in one single sub-population during
 one time unit 
\begin_inset Formula $tstep$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we improve the Direct Method for one single population by adding
 a random number to calculate chance which sub-population to fire.
 Starting from the initial states, the stochastic simulation algorithms
 simulate the trajectory in population processes by repeatedly answering
 the following three big questions and updating the states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When (time) will the next event occur? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which subpopulation where the event will occur next? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which event in the subpopulation will occur next? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although, it is a small improvement in the original Direct Method, however
 it turns back much more benefits for a meta-population, it well presents
 the interactions between subpopulations in the metapopulation.

 Adaptive tau-leaping algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step, we provide basic concepts for the adaptive tau-leaping algorithm
 by using the detailed description of Cao [Cao2007].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Markov process at time t, to describe a metapopulation of n subpopulatio
ns, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
state set:
\series default
 X(t)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $X(t):=[S_{1}(t),...,S_{n}(t),E_{1}(t),...,E_{n}(t),I_{1}(t),...,I_{n}(t),R_{1}(t),...,R_{n}(t)]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
each variables of 
\begin_inset Formula $X(t)$
\end_inset

 is defined on the non-negative integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
set of allowable transitions:
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula ${\triangle_{j}}$
\end_inset

, for each allowable transition, 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, we define a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

, by using a function independent on t but dependent on the current state
 
\begin_inset Formula $X(t)$
\end_inset

, to calculate transition rates given the state 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda(X))$
\end_inset

 through the deterministic model, and a vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 integers, 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle_{j}:=[\triangle_{j,1},...,\triangle_{j,n}]$
\end_inset

, that reflects the change in state if this transition were followed: 
\begin_inset Formula $X(t)+\triangle_{j}$
\end_inset

.

operation:
\series default
 with the SEIR model, the package simulates a trajectory from time 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to a stopping time 
\begin_inset Formula $tmax$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the description of Cao and al.
 in 2007, a good time period of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is during which all transition rates remain approximately constant and
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 state variables remain greater than zero with probability
\begin_inset Formula $\thicksim1$
\end_inset

.
 Then, by using the Poisson-dustributed number of transitions, that should
 have occurred during this period: 
\begin_inset Formula $X(t+\tau)\approx X(t)+\sum_{j}y_{j}\triangle_{j}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}\thicksim Poisson(\tau\lambda_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 To successfully apply this algorithm, we need to know that, transition
 rates frequently change and in balancing efficiency with accuracy when
 selecting these time periods to leap over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, in the package "dizzysNewInfec" we have build successfully the
 Direct method and "tau-leap method" for a meta-population.
 In the particular case, there is one single sub-population, the Direct
 Method and "tau-leap" method for a meta-population are similar to the original
 methods.
