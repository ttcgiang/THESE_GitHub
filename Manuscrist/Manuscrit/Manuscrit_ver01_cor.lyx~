Epidemiology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we know that public health problems are one of the emerging troubles
 in the entire world.
 They directly influence human heath, the health of one person, the health
 of a community.
 In particular, any news about infectious diseases for children has always
 been a subject of concern to parents as well as everyone.
 Hence, in the world, a discipline 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

epidemiology
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 has risen to study the factors, causes, and effects of infectious diseases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is proposed in a context in which many public health serious
 events have occurred in the world : SRAS in 2003, avian influenza in 2004
 or swine flu in 2009, etc.

In particular, at the start of 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO)
 officially stated global measles epidemic outbreak.
 In the first three months of the year 2014, there were about 56,000 cases
 of measle infections in 75 countries

, particularly in southeast Asia and in Vietnam

.
 This has pointed out the important role of the epidemiological phenomena
 anticipation when diseases occur.
 Many studies proposed by the WHO, the Pasteur Institute and the Inserm
 in the field of "environmental security" try to understand disease phenomena
 and spread of disease over a territory, to better manage when diseases
 occur.
 These researches consist of mathematical or statistical studies via surveillanc
e networks

Control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we know, pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites
 or fungi are key factors causing infectious diseases.
 The diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another,
 through a mediate environment or contaminated tools.
 As far as directly infectious diseases are concerned, meaninf diseases
 directly transmitted from one person to another, we have some normal policies
 to prevent the spread of diseases such as vaccines, anti-viral medications,
 and quarantine.
 In this thesis, we focus on vaccines in the human community.
 A vaccine is understood as a biological preparation that provides active
 acquired immunity to a particular disease for our body.
 After having been vaccinated, we transport microorganisms in weakened or
 killed form of the microbe into our body.
 The body's immune system produces the right antibodies to recognize the
 germs as a threat, destroy them and keep a record of them.
 Because of that, when the disease occurs, our immune system can recognize
 and destroy with a better chance of success any of these germs that it
 later encounters.
 The administration of vaccines is called vaccination.
 Vaccination has greatly helped human beings.
 The vaccination of influenza, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and chicken pox
 have been particularly appreciated.
 Smallpox is a particular example.
 This disease was filled people with terror during the closing years of
 the 18th century.
 Smallpox killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually and among the people
 that luckily survived, a third had been blinded by the disease.
 However, the World Health Organization (WHO) offcially stated the eradication
 of smallpox in 2011

 In addition, many infectious diseases are clearly restricted such as influenza,
 polio, measles and tetanus from much of the world.
 Thus, one big question proposed is why many infectious diseases still exist
 in the world though we have produced vaccines for most infectious diseases.
 In order to answer this question, first of all, we have to answer to some
 following small questions :

With the four answers above, we can say that the human still faces up to
 infectious diseases.
 A thorough knowledge of the disease is essential in order to implement
 large-scale proper infection control measures and prevention campaigns.
 Granted that the disease transmission methods depend on the characteristics
 of each disease and the nature of the microorganism that causes it.
 In this thesis, we will investigate popular infectious diseases with transmissi
on by direct contact.
 This transmission requires a close contact between an infected person and
 a susceptible person, such as touching an infected individual, kissing,
 sexual contact with oral saliva, or contact with body lesions.
 Therefore, these diseases usually occur between members of the same household
 or close friends and family.
 In particular, this thesis will mostly focus on measles.
 Because measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus.
 It is a typical infectiuous disease with direct transmission.
 In 1980, approximate 2.6 milion people was killed each year before we had
 the widespread vaccination policies.
 It spreads very fast by coughing and sneezing in human communities via
 close interpersonal contact or direct contact with secretions.
 Its main symptoms consist of high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.
 These first symptoms usually take from 10 to 12 days after exposure to
 an infectious person, and lasts 4 to 7 days 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "panum1988observations"

\end_inset

.
 In fact, now there is no proper treatment for measles to totally prevent
 the spread of measles except routine measles vaccination policy for children.
 According to the report by the World Health Organization (WHO), since 2002
 measles was eradicated from U.S.
 However, today measles vaccination has not been extensively popularized
 in the entire world.
 Beside the obtained results, for example, in 2013, there was about 84%
 of the world's children having received one dose of measles vaccine, and
 during 2000-2013, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 15.6 million
 deaths; we have had to face upabout 145700 measles deaths globally- estimated
 400 deaths every day or 16 deaths every hour in 2013.
 Measles becomes one of the leading causes of death among young children
 in the world, although now we are having a big stock of safe and readily
 available measles vaccines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mass policy (or the routine measles vaccination policy for measlses) that
 vaccinates the maximum number of children before a certain age, is the
 oldest (started from the 1950s in the rich countries) and is now the most
 used.
 The policy has obtained clear results : a clear decrease of the incidence
 in most countries.
 However, the problem of this vaccination policy is too expensive, really
 ineffective and quite impossible to implement in poor countries, especially
 in Africa because of both financial and logistical problems.
 (e.g.
 the WHO project

In addition, when a vaccination policy is performed in a country, there
 is only one policy deployed, but in modeling, we can realize many policies
 and assess their results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, measles is still a common and often fatal disease in the world.
 We still very much need to model the transmission dynamics of measles and
 investigate the effect of vaccination on the spread of measles in the entire
 world.
 More largely, we need to give new optimal vaccination policies in artificial
 intelligence in order that these policies may become more effective, less
 expensive, and take into account the spatial dimension for all popular
 infectious diseases.

\begin_layout Itemize
For directly transmitted infectious diseases by virus and bacteria, susceptible
 individuals are not only infected by infected individuals in the same location,
 but also by other infected individuals due to the movement of individuals
 between populated regions.
 This is one very important part in the domain studying the geographical
 spread of infectious diseases.
 We care for host population characteristics, then characteristics of spatial
 spread of an infectious disease among populations.
 Through these characteristics, we find optimal policies to minimize the
 number of infected individuals in a community.
 In fact, there are many studies about the interactions among populations.
 However, we can divide the spatial structure of populations into two main
 levels: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

inter-city level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intra-city level
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 At the inter-city level (or called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 ( also called

 intra-city traffic.
 We consider the effect of travel through the connections between population
 regions as a means of spreading a virus

 A population may be simplified as a city, community, or some other geographical
 region.
 Population travel (e.g.
 among animals and among people by foot, birds, mosquitoes and in particular,
 people travel by air from one city to another), is the main reason why
 diseases can spread quickly among very distant cities such as SARS disease
 in 2003.
 Therefore, the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metapopulation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arrived in the ecological literature in 1969 by Levins 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969,hanski1991metapopulation"

\end_inset

.
 A metapopulation is a population of a set of spatially discrete local populatio
ns (or subpopulations in short) with mutual interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

.
 In the metapopulation in which a subpopulation can only go extinct locally
 and be recolonized by another after it is emptied by extinction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bolker1996,Hanski1998,Levins1969"

\end_inset

 and migration between subpopulaitons is significantly restricted.
 In a metapopulation, if recolonization rates are smaller than extinction
 rates, then total extinction of all local population will easily be reached.
 The persistence time of the metapopulation is measured as the time until
 all subpopulations go extinct.
 According to Harrison (1991) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 there are four types of spatially dynamic populations : classic Levins
 metapopulation, mainland-island metapopualtion, patchy population and non-equil

It is evident that smaller subpopulations have a high probability of local
 extinction, but the mainland population will hardly become extinct.
 The migration from the mainland to the islands is independent of the islands
 white or filled, but is propagated for the connected islands.
 Therefore, if the mainland population has a low individual density and
 there is no immigration, then population growth rate is positive.
 Inversely, if island populations are in the same conditions as the mainland,
 then its population growth rate is negative.
 Thus, the islands would go down to extinction if there are no imemigrants.

\begin_layout Standard
We already have four metapopulation models.
 In order to model the metapopulations mentioned above, we have three main
 model to implement : spatially-implicit model, spatially-explicit model
 and spatially-realistic model.
 For the first model, this is the type of model used in Levins (1969) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Levins1969"

\end_inset

 in which supposing that all local populations are connected with each other
 and they have independent local fluctuations.
 At any one time, we save track of the proportion of local populations and
 we do not take care the distance between them and the population size of
 each subpopulation.
 This model are mathematically and conceptually easy to implement.
 But this model can only answer some metapopulation problems because it
 ignores so many variables of a metapopulation.
 This model should be used for metapopulation close to a steady state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the second model, the spatially-explicit model is more complex than
 the first model.
 Subpopulations may be filled or vacant.
 Local populations only have interactions with the nearest neighbors.
 Subpopulations are organized as cells on a grid and migration among them
 depends on population density.
 We also only consider presence or absence of a species in each subpopulation.
 The advantage of this model is easy to model because of same local behaviors
 from subpopulation to subpopulation.
 However, we cannot simply describe the state of the metapopulation through
 filled subpopulations.
 Finally, the spatially-realistic model uses GIS to realize attributes,
 geometric coordinates, etc ...
 to a metapopulation.
 The first author using this model is Hanski in 1994 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hanski1994practical"

\end_inset

.
 His model was defined as the incidence function (IF) model.
 This model is more realistic, and we can estimate quantitative predictions
 about metapopulation fluctuation.
 However, in fact, this model is very complicated, and many geographic data
 have to be estimated.
 Hence, the metapopulation concept start to no longer exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the scope of this thesis, we focus on a metapopulation model that is
 result of combination between the spatially-explicit model and the patchy
 population.
 In general, this a simple spatial model, but is one of the most applicable
 model to descrire spread of diseases in human communities.
 This metapopulation consists of distinct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

subpopulation, each of which fluctuates independently, together with interaction
 limited by a coupling parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 These subpopulations may be filled or empty and contact with any neighbours.

Epidemiologic models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that, there are many current models that are used to model complex
 systems in nature, in ecology system and in epidemiology.
 Mathematical models in epidemiology are a typical exemple.
 These models permit us to present behavior of diseases and disease process
 in mathematics.
 However, explaining the transmission of infectious diseases is a difficult
 problem for an epidemiologist.
 Because there are many different interacting factors causing the outbreak
 of diseases such as the environment, the climate, the geography, the culture,...He
nce, the role of the epidemiologist is how to model the characteristics
 and the transmission process of an infectious disease.
 Researchers have proposed compartmental models in epidemiology by dividing
 the population into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that illustrate health states of human through individuals.
 These compartmental models are called the epidemic models too.
 The first benefit of these models is to model the transmission process
 of a communicable disease through compartments.
 Then, we can predict the properties of the disease dynamics such as the
 estimated number of infected individual, the time of persistence of disease,
 further that where and when we can implement vaccination policies to have
 both a minimum number of vaccined individuals and the minimum number of
 infected individuals in a given population.
 Let image that now in your country, there is an infectious disease as measles,
 a baby can be infected.
 According to the process of infection of disease, firstly this baby was
 born, he is fine and he is not infected yet by the measles but he may be
 infected in the future.
 We say that he belongs to the susceptible group (in short, S).
 Then, his mother takes him to a supermaket, there he see so many people,
 he is really infected through any way.
 He starts having a high fever, he may have to pass this state from 3 days
 to 5 days.
 In this period, he is really infected but he cannot infecte others.
 We say that he belong to the exposed group (in short, E).
 After that, he start decreasing the temperature, but at the same time,
 he begins having red rashs on the back of the ears, after a few hours,
 on the head, on the neck and finally most of the body.
 This period appears from five to eight days after the exposed step.
 This duration is very sensible.
 The baby is completely infected and he can infecte others if they see him.
 He belongs to the infected group (in short, I).
 Finally, he passes to the final period, he comes back good state.
 We say that he belongs to the recovered group with immunity (in short,
 R).

 propagation in community, there are many epidemic models proposed.
 We give here the development of epidemic models by focusing on acute infections
, assuming the pathogen causes illness for a periods of time followed by
 (typically lifelong) immunity.
 The first simplest model is the S-I-R model created by W.
 O.
 Kermack and A.
 G.
 McKendrick in 1927.
 The authors categorized hosts within groups as described above 
\series bold
S
\series default
usceptible (if not yet exposed to the pathogen), 
\series bold
I
\series default
nfected (if currenly infected by the pathogen) and 
\series bold
R
\series default
ecovered (if they have successfully cleared the infection).
 From the simplest SIR model, in order to accord each infectious disease
 and real property of disease, scientists have modified it, made it different
 multiforme.
 However, in shape of this thesis, we concentrate on the SEIR model (as
 the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) that fit many currently infectious diseases in the world.
 Each patient must pass four health steps : susceptible stage, incubation
 stage, infectious stage and recovered stage.

The conceptual descriptions of the model can be represented by a flow diagram

 The flow diagram for the SEIR model uses arrows to present the movement
 between the S and I classes, the E and I classes and the I and R classses.

In detail, the deterministic model performs the same way for a given set
 of initial conditions.
 It doesn't have randomness, dynamics, and don't present dynamic of diseases
 in nature.
 Thus, stochastic models have been proposed.
 A stochastic model is always more realistic than a deterministic one.
 These models have stochastic and variable states are not described by unique
 values, but by probability distributions.
 It is why we will use the stochastic models to predict extinction propability
 of disease in spatial context

Algorithmes de simulation stochastique

\begin_layout Standard
Stochastic simulation works on variables that both are random and can be
 changed with certain probability.
 Today, these stochastic models have been used widely in many domain because
 of some reasons as following : before, in order to model chemically reacting
 systems, in simple way, we solved a set of coupled ordinary differential
 equations (ODEs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "li2007stochastic"

\end_inset

of deterministic approches.
 Basically, these approches use the law of mass action that shows a simple
 relation between reaction rate and molecular component concentrations.
 We start with a given set of initial molecular concentrations, the law
 of mass action permits us to see the component concentrations over time.
 The states of a reaction are a homogeneous, free medium.
 The reaction rate will be directly scaled with the concentrations of the
 elements.
 Most systems can use the traditional deterministic approches to simulate.
 It is evident that many systems such as some biochemical systems consist
 of random, discreate interactions between individual elements.
 However, in the case, these systems becomes smaller and smaller, the traditiona
l deterministic models may not be accurate.
 It is the reason for that the fluctuations of these systems can be simulated
 exactly by applying stochastic models, particularly as well as the Stochastic
 Simulation Algorithms (SSA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1976general,gillespie1977exact"

\end_inset

.
 The SSA describes time-evolution statistically correct trajectories of
 finite populations in continuous time by solving the corresponding stochastic
 differential equations.
 Using the stochastic models can solve three questions.
 (1) These models take account the discrete character of the number of elements
 and the evidently random character of collision among elements.
 (2) They coincide with the theories of thermodynalics and stochastic processes.
 (3) They are a good idea to describe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

small systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instable systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The main idea of the stochastic models is that element reactions are essentiall
y random processes.
 We don't know certainly how a reaction occur at a moment.
 We also call it the process stochasticity.
 In particular, in the process stochasticity, we talk about demographic
 and environmental stochasticities in epidemic models.
 The demographic stochasticity is strongly controlled by population size
 such as the birth and death rates, contamination,etc.
 But, the environmental stochasticity is just affected by environmental
 factors what we can not govern.
 Therefore, there are many epidemic models that forcus on exploration of
 demographic stochasticity.
 Demographic stochasticity is considered as fluctuation in population processes
 that are based the random nature of events at the level of the individual.
 Each event is related to one baseline probability fixed, individuals are
 presented in differing fates due to chance.
 In addition to the demographic stochasticity, the number of infectious,
 susceptible, exposed and recovered individuals is now required to be an
 interger.
 Modeling approches that incorporate demographic stochasticity are called
 event-driven methods.
 These methods require explicit consideration of events.
 The first aprroach published by Daniel T.Gillespie in 1976 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gillespie1976general"

\end_inset

 is an exact stochastic simulation approach for chemical kinetics.
 The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) has become the standard
 procedure of the discrete-event modelling by taking proper value of the
 available randomness in such a system.
 The methods modelling the event-driven model demands explicit presentation
 of events.
 For the santard SEIR model, we have to consider the nine events that can
 occur, each causing the numbers in the relative groups to go up or down
 by one.

To implement this SEIR stochastic model, there are many different methods,
 thought most researchers often use the method of Gillespie in 1977.
 Starting from the initial states, the stochastic simulation algorithms
 simulate the trajectory in population processes by repeatedly answering
 the following two questions and updating the states.

If supposing that generate one random number takes

\end_inset

 time.
 Then the FRM takes 
\begin_inset Formula $nC_{rand}$
\end_inset

 time per step.
 It is a big problem for that Gillespie proposed a new improved algorithm
 in 1976.
 The FRM has three main disadvantages : (1) generating random numbers is
 relatively slow, (2) the FRM generates a cycle too many random numbers
 in the case where the simulation time is big and the random number generator
 will have tend on saturation when it generates too many numbers, (3) the
 FRM is difficult for indexing the events to effectively implement the update
 step.
