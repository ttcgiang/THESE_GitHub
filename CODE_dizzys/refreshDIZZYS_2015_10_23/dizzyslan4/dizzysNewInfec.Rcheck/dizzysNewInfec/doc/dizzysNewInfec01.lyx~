dizzysNewInfec: efficient deterministic/stochastic simulations in R for
 a metapopulation by using SIR/SEIR models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Predicting the potential spread of an infectious disease is still a difficult
 problem for scientists.
 It requires much more than simple connecting subpopulations in a metapopulation
 and takes into account many factors about the pathogen and the affected
 subpopulation.
 Therefore, this 'dizzysNewInfec' package allows us to simulate dynamics
 of an infectious disease through subpopulations by using the SIR/SEIR models
 and by implementing the direct algorithm of Gillespie in 1977 and the adaptive
 tau leaping to approximate the trajectory of a continuous-time stochastic
 process.
 Consequently, result returned is biological data in time horizon about
 the disease dynamic, we can perform analysis on this biological data.
 This vignette presents a few examples of SIR/SEIR applied to biological
 problems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fundamentally, Kermack-McKendrick gave the first epidemic model to provide
 a mathematical description of the kinetic transmission of an infectious
 disease in an unstructured subpopulation.
 According to this model, today we have known well the SIR/SEIR deterministic
 epidemic models.
 This is the two basic models very popularly used by scientists.
 However, Keeling2008

 show that all the deterministic models are essentially fixed "clockwork"
 systems with the same starting conditions, exactly the same trajectory
 is always observed.
 It isn't right for dynamics of real pathogens in the real-world.
 So stochastic models are created and concerned with approximating or mimicking
 the random or probabilistic element from the deterministic models.
 Moreover, when the quantities in a system are small enough and extinction
 is probable to occur, then stochastic effects become critical to take into
 account.
 This is reason, in the 'dizzysNewInfec' package, it permits us to obtain
 the dynamics of the deterministic and the approximate dynamics of the stochasti
c epidemic models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the stochastic models, their processes are in Markov process, it
 means that the future state of the process, conditional on the present
 state, is independent of the past.
 In the case, our package focus on simulating dynamics from a continuous-time
 Markov process for which the transition rates are constants, isn't a function
 of time.
 We use the exact algorithm of Gillespie in 1977 and the approximate algorithm
 described as the "adaptive tau-leaping algorithm".
 With these two algorithms, each has its private advantages and its private
 disadvantages.
 For the exact algorithm, it give us a really exact approach of simulating
 population-based time-to-event through two step with many iterations of
 1) searching the time of next event by an exponentially distributed function
 and 2) searching the nature of next event.
 This Gillespie's solution becomes too slow and impractical as any one transitio
n rate grows large.
 Hence, approximate models are born instead of the Gillespie's solution,
 they are concerned with larger transition rates and with increasing simulation
 speed while still maintaining reasonable accuracy.
 The "adaptive tau-leaping algorithm" known as an approximate method reduces
 the number of iterations by treating transition rates as constant over
 time periods for which this approximation leads to little error

 package in R implements both the exact solution and the approximate solution
 for the SIR and SEIR models by integrating the R package and the C++ implementa
tion.
 We can choose one of the two solutions to simulate when the number of subpopula
tions in a metapopulation increases.
 We use C++ to perform the algorithms, and R to create interfaces.
 Therefore, new implementation is much faster than any pure R implementation.
 Moreover, we introduce a new interpretation of the probabilistic derivation
 of multi-population epidemic model.

Methods

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, first we will talk about the deterministic model, the stochasti
c model of the SEIR model.
 Then, we will have transformation the SEIR model into the SIR model through
 the usage of the two algorithms.
 We hope that the models and the algorithms should be well understood before
 obtainning simulation results.
