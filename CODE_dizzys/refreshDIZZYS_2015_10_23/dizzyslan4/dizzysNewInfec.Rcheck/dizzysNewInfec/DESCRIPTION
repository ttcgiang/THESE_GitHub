Description: This package permit us to simulate infectious diseases by using the SIR/SEIR models. To do that, we implement the direct algorithm of Gillespie in 1977 as described in the book "Modeling Infectious Diseases IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS" by Keeling and Pejman Rohani (2008), and the adaptive tau leaping to approximate the trajectory of a continuous-time stochastic process as described by Cao et al. (2007) The Journal of Chemical Physics. This package is based upon work supported by the Institute de Recherche pour Developpement at Paris in France and by Jean-Daniel Zucker and Marc Choisy.
