EpiDynamics 0.2
===============

* SIRAdditiveNoise:

* SIRDemogStoch: updated name for SIRDemoStochastic function.

* SIRTauLeap:

* SISDemogStoch:

* Plots of results added to the exmaples section in functions' documentation.


EpiDynamics 0.1.2
=================

* DESCRIPTION: imports update.

* SIRScaledAdditiveNoise: Solves a SIR model with scaled additive noise.

* SIRDemoStochastic: Solves a SIR model with demographic stochasticity.

* SIR2TypesImports: Solves a model with two types of stochastic imports.

* SIR2Stages: it is now called SIR2AgeClasses. 


EpiDynamics 0.1.1
=================

* DESCRIPTION: imports update.

* PlotModels: renamed as PlotMods to avoid conflicts with PlotModels function
              from the capm package. In addition, bug fixed to use correctly
              the 'variables' argument in the intended way.
